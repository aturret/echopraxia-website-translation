	 Pedophilia in a Pill
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>You may remember <a href="..\..\articles\brainontrial.htm">the case</a> a few years back of the Floridian hypersexual pedophile whose depravity hailed from a brain tumor; the dude (rightly) got off, since he wasn't culpable for the wiring in his head.  You may even remember me taking the next step (<a href="..\..\newscrawl_2004-1.htm">scroll down to June 30th on the right-hand side</a>), and remarking that the tumor didn't really make a difference— <i>nobody</i> is responsible for the way their heads are wired, and the legal system had taken the first step (again, rightly) towards acknowledging that the very <i>concept </i>of culpability, while convenient, is neurologically unsound.<br><br><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/paedophilia-blamed-on-teachers-medication-927095.html">Exhibit B</a>*: Phillip Carmichael, a former Oxfordshire headmaster and pedophile, exonerated after a court decided that his extensive collection of child porn had been amassed while under the influence of prescription drugs.  Once again we see evidence that we are mechanical.  The very phrase "control yourself" is dualist at its heart, a logical impossibility.  It conjures up images of a driver fighting to stop a careening car with bad brakes.  But the fact is, there is no driver.  There is only the car— <i>we</i> are the car— and when the brake lines have been cut, careening is just what cars <i>do</i>.  Medical professionals prescribed a bunch of pills to this man, and they literally turned him into someone else.<br><br>You might think that this would make people feel a bit more kindly towards natural-born kiddy-diddlers.  After all, if it's a chemical that turn you into a pervert, you're not really culpable, are you?  You're taking the same drugs Carmichael was; the only difference is that they're not being produced by the factory Pharm down the road, they're being produced in your own head.  If anything, natural-born pedophiles have even less choice in the matter than did our Exhibit B;  at least Carmichael could have chosen more competent medical council.<br><br>I would be willing to bet, though, that most people would <i>not</i> think more kindly of pedophiles after performing this thought experiment, and in fact most people would vilify and shout down anyone who <i>dared </i>to make excuses for these monsters.  Anything to do with kids is, by definition, a motherhood issue; and motherhood issues by definition turn us into irrational idiots.<br><br>But our legal systems generally define culpability in terms of whether offenders know that their acts are against the law, and by that standard I guess some kind of punishment is called for.  Still.  Let's at least be consistent about it, shall we?  We know that a human system called Phillip Carmichael deliberately broke the law; it just wasn't the same Phillip Carmichael who ended up in court after the drugs were withdrawn.  <i>That</i> Carmichael had been rebooted back into a benign, Linux sort of personality.  The evil child-molesting Microsoft OS had been wiped.  So if you want to be consistent about this, put Carmichael back on drugs until the guilty iteration reappears.  <i>Then</i> put him in jail.<br><br>At least you'd know you have the right guy.<br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:85%;">*Thanks to Nas Hedron for the link</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a></p>

        <p>This is a goodie.  I wish I didn't have to go home so soon, but here is pass#1:<br><br>1. Legality is matter of precedent, and it sways with the culture, so today's crazed pedophile was ancient Greece's normal citizen.<br><br>2. You know that the legal system cannot dictate biology - just because the court says, okay, if you stop taking your Pedolactrine, you are cured, that doesn't make it so.  Collecting kiddie porn is way more than getting some bad pharma; the substrate of propensity must be present, whether you agree it was hardwired at birth, imprinted or learned. I will agree pharmaceuticals might lower thresholds or impair judgement, but *make* you a pedophile out of whole cloth?  Improbable.<br>Law and biology are not one item.<br><br>3. I like your car image, BUT, unless it's Kit, that car from the 70's Knightrider show, human "cars" believe they have free will, and have some moment of decision before they commit to bad acts.  <br><br>4. What does the law require for you to be culpable?  What are the set of threshold conditions that must be met for culpability?<br><br>Gotta go; you guys have fun!</p>

        <p>If one is in a car with bad brakes, one doesn't take it on the track.  (Or one learns to decelerate via downshift.)  What this means for the poor sod on the highway who suddenly discovers his massive machine won't stop fast enough, I'm not sure.  (Except that there will be a definite crunch, and insurance takes the rest.)  There is an argument to be made that the limitations of one's machine dictate acceptable actions - the pedophile learns not to hang around the school.<br><br>Unfortunately, this argument also leads to the false god of faith, whereby if one's compulsion towards God is strong enough, the temptations may be surmounted, and the man who wants to fuck men marries a nice girl and settles down because that's what he's supposed to do.  How much of an animal do we allow ourselves to be?  How much of the faulty wiring and misconnected neurons do we accept and embrace, and how much are we obliged to want to bury?<br><br>More importantly, how do we want to not want something?</p>

        <p>If culpability is truly an illusion, then it's reasonable to assume that rehabilitation - aside from some sort of major medical intervention - is also. <br><br>Wouldn't that argue for mandatory life sentences for pedophiles?<br><br>What about mandatory medical procedures?<br><br>Also, would a crime even need to be committed if medical tests could prove that an individual has the "pedophile brain"? If culpability is an illusion, why wait for the loaded gun to go off?<br><br>Anything less would be putting the larger population at risk. <br><br>Culpability or no, society has a responsibility to protect it's members from harm. <br><br>Pedophilia is the hot-button issue, but I imagine this reasoning could be extended to murder, etc.<br><br>Can of worms, there.</p>

        <p>Lots of good points taken, PW.  And you're right, the real test of someone's commitment to thinking clearly is to see if they can keep it together when you run edgy pedophilia suggestions by them.  <br><br>But here's a consideration.  I've got no beef with the hardcore, material monism you're running.  But human nervous systems are exceedingly complex to the point that their behaviors may not be deterministic in any simple manner.  That drives a bit of a wedge in your car analogy.  Furthermore, it would appear that while drugs, chemical states, and tumors can obviously make people do stuff, even crazy stuff (there's also a Parkinson's drug that makes a small percentage of its users into pathological gamblers), it's also true that talking to them, reasoning with them, getting them to try to exert some control on their behavior, and just flat deciding to do X from their subjective perspective also seems to be causally effective at bringing about outcomes.  And these so-called rational means can be the most effective or the only effective means to getting the desired outcomes.  So if that's right, then how could we not employ a punishment system that treats people as responsible, free agents and thereby tries to impose some moral responsibility on them?  <br><br>Matt McCormick</p>

        <p>Well, the legal part of your argument assumes that the purpose of law enforcement, courts, and prisons, is to punish the guilty.  It is, in most countries on Earth, but unfortunately that may be the worst possible purpose for those institutions*.  It spends vast amounts of resources, both economic and human, to create hardened criminals and other sorts of people who can function less well in society than when they were put there.  And the feeling of "closure" we all get from punishing these miscreants?  Priceless? No, it costs us a lot.  Valueless, though.  It doesn't make the damage they did any less, or reduce the suffering of their victims at all.  But it sure makes us monkeys feel good.<br><br>As for the argument against free will, I doubt we're anywhere near knowing enough about how our brains and/or minds work to say anything meaningful about it**.<br><br>* No, not the worst, I guess.

        <p>While you argument is interesting for argument's sake, I can't help but notice that you're not presenting any consquences.  Okay, let's say we all decide baby-touchers aren't to blame because they can't help their wiring (never mind that the baby-touchers' victims tend to grow up to touch babies themselves, which kind of implies there might be a little bit of nurture mixed up in your nature).

        <p>I have to agree with SpeakerToManagers. Sentencing a man to prison serves two purposes other than sheer vengeance: <br>1. It takes the offender away from society and into a place where it can't do any harm to free citizens.<br>2. It provides a deterrent, making people less likely to perform offenses. Obviously, the threat is more important than the actual punishment, but it has to be acted upon to be effective.<br><br>These two reasons don't require culpability. If a car is broken and the brake lines are cut, TAKE IT OFF THE ROAD.</p>

We consist of a whole lot of neurochemicals, many of which are bound up into very similiar impulses. It's reasonable to assume - and from my experience doing civil service at a psychatry, evident - that there will be some thusly reinforced traits more resistant to inputs than others. <br>So, call it soul or call it the hardened wiring, I see no reason why there should not be a quasi-substrate.</p>

If he agrees to take it each year, freely, with no arm twisting, both me and we can be assured that he will not act on his proclivity because that part of the feedback loop is gone.<br><br>Too 1984?
