	 Revenge of the Butterballs
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>A few years back — before he ascended into Heaven with the angels — Cory Doctorow submitted a nifty little story to the Gibralter Point writing workshop (an annual affair for which, come to think of it, I am about to depart this very weekend).  I don't remember the title, but one of the central characters was this geeky pudgeball who, by hacking his own metabolic software,  morphed into a ripped hi-def hard body without having to exercise.  (This was at the height of the second Atkins craze, when eating a stack of bunless bacon cheeseburgers had stopped being a "weird-ass diet" and had started being a new way to "hack the body".)  Sitting in the Commons afterwards, Cory expressed his outrage at the fact that the human body has to exercise for at least twenty minutes before flipping into fat-burning mode.  "Suppose you want to read a book at night," he analogized, decrying the need for physical exercise, "and the light will only stay on if you keep hitting the switch every two seconds.  We're supposed to applaud the guy who sits there all night hitting the switch?  Why not just rig the damn thing so it <i>stays on</i>?"<br><br>"But Cory," said I, from my vantage point of greater age and vastly greater biological wisdom, "you're assuming that we're living in some kind of magical Corytopia where there's another option.  You seem to think we all drag our asses out the door to go running at six a.m. because we're too stupid to just pop the hardbody pill in the medicine cabinet.  But there <i>is</i> no hardbody pill.  Not yet.  So for the time being, you either keep hitting the damn switch or you stop reading when the sun goes down."  And we both went away happy; me because I was right, and Cory because his story sold to Salon the next week and got optioned for a movie deal the week after.<br><br>Only now, Cory still has his option deal, and I'm not even right any more.  Because now there's this new drug, AICAR, that tricks the body into thinking that it's just had a massive workout and had better start building more type-1 muscle fibers (original research <a href="..\..\articles\Narkar_et_al_Exercise_Mimetics_Cell_2008.html">here</a>; NYT article<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/science/01muscle.html"> here</a>).  Basically, we're talking triathlete-in-a-pill here.  While the drug has so far worked its magic only on mice, they've already developed a test to detect its presence in cheating Olympic athletes so you know it's only a matter of time before people are using the stuff.  And not much time, either; as obesity expert Richard Bergman opines, "the couch potato segment of the population might find this to be a good regimen".  Duh, ya <i>think</i>?<br><br>You know what pisses me off about this, even more than Cory being right (again)?  It's the fact that I've been hitting that damn switch every two seconds for pretty much my whole life.  I first started doing pushups back in grade seven, when Keith Gill spat on my bike and I knew that he'd beat the crap out of me if I spat back on his, even though he was smaller than me. Ever since it's been a rearguard fight against entropy.  I lose anywhere from six to nine hours weekly to running and working out, depending on the weather; I did an online questionnaire once and discovered that all this exercise will devour seven years of my life, and gain me only five in expected lifespan (which is a net loss of two years, if you're having trouble with the math).  More than a workday per week devoted to fitness and I'm <i>still</i> only slowing the inevitable slide to terminal decay.<br><br>And now, any 200-kilo couch potato with a health card is gonna be able to pop a few pills and turn into The Rock while watching American fucking Idol?  There better be side-effects, is all I can say.  Really serious ones.  I'm talking gonadal tumors the side of grapefruits.  I'm talking primordial cysts erupting through newly-chiseled faces at time-lapse speed, right in the middle of a first date.  I <i>demand</i> it.<br><br>Because otherwise, you know what?  Life just wouldn't be <i>fair</i>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biotech.html">biotech</a></p>

        <p>LOL...I hear ya. I'm in pretty much the same boat time-wise (mostly running, with a hour-an-a-half or so of gym), and I agree. NOT fucking fair. (I almost said friggin', then I remembered the title of the damn blog...*grin*). <br><br>And don't even TALK about my wife...she works out about 15-20 hours a week..it's practically a part-time job. I told her about this, and the idea that her lay-about friends might just be able to take a pill and look half as good as her hot bod...makes her cranky. <br><br>Oh, and I think the story was "0wnz0red": http://craphound.com/?p=123</p>

        <p>On the other hand, exercise comes with that nifty endorphin cookie. And all those interesting skills you can build while doing it. And the emotional benefits. And the bonding time with pals, if you are doing something that involves social activity.<br><br>And nothing solves plot problems like going for a run--for me, anyway. (Also, I happen to know that Cory does yoga. ;-) )</p>

        <p>Yeah, I hit the switch all the time with yoga.  Gotta do it.<br><br>As always, I agree with the brilliant Bear.  Can you get Eureka in a pill?  I think not!<br><br>And stuff liek this always makes me think it's fucking with the software in werid ways we are not totally aware of.

        <p>Well, they're not about to start shipping co-ordination in a pill, nor stamina. So ripped muscles aren't going to detract from the point that they're still going to be a wheezing bunch of maladroits on the way to the fridge for another lard sandwich.</p>

        <p>A year or two ago, I read an article on a German boy, the child of parents who were both Olympic athletes, who had inherited a genetic deficiency from both parents where his body created almost no body fat. Instead, he just built more muscle.<br><br>In the article, they mentioned using gene therapy or somesuch to shut down the fat-building gene in cattle to generate more lean meat, but, of course, the first thing I thought of was athletes using this for "performance enhancement."<br><br>On the other hand, I wonder if this kid follows his parents into sports, would he have an unfair advantage even though he was born with it?</p>

        <p>"exercise comes with that nifty endorphin cookie"<br><br>Naturally. We'll never develop drugs to make you high, to fool the brain into thinking something great is going on. Oh. Ooops. <br><br>Also, Vernor Vinge has you all beat (what's that you say? Vernor Vinge predicted something that's come to pass? How suprising). In <i>Rainbows End</i>, without spoiling it all for you, one of the characters gets his arm badly damaged. Essentially, the medical elite leave the damn shreds hanging off his shoulder rather than giving him a plastic-and-processor replacement because it's likely they'll be able to just GROW him a new arm for half the price of a prosthetic in about two years. I forget his name for it, but I think he called it "prospective medicine." Good things come to those that wait. Deal with it.  <br><br>This thought has been at the back of my mind ever since I saw the TED with Ray Kurzwiel chatting about the drug that flicks off the cell receptors that cause them to absorb fat. If I remember correctly, it belonged to a class of drugs whimsically named "FIRKOs" for fat specific insulin receptor knock out. It's worked damn good in mice thus far, and it will make the leap to us humans before long. You can send your Krispy Kreme Cheeseburgers (yeah, they exist) and deep-fried Mars Bars to Dr. C. Ronald Kahn in thanks.  <br><br>But yeah. I'm suprised at you, PW, that you haven't noted that science tends to march along with little care for the effects of the technology it gives birth to. While wasting your life being a muscly jock must be incredibly painful, I'm sure all those people who died from AIDS will sypathize especially in light of the moderatly seismic announcements that we can now destroy the viruses with lasers pulsed according to the De Broglie wavelength of the envelope protein or just turn the damn things off altogether with the much-touted abzymes, which might cure the damn thing in a few years. Maybe you could start a support group? <br><br>Good post though. Lately I've seen a proponderance of "x is no longer valid because of y" where "x" is some terrible thing and y is some wonderful cure.

Oh, and I think the story was "0wnz0red"</i><br><br>Yes, that's the one.<br><br><b> Elizabeth Bear</b> said...<br><br><i>On the other hand, exercise comes with that nifty endorphin cookie....   And nothing solves plot problems like going for a run--for me, anyway.</i> <br><br>Since others have taken Ursabelle to task for that whole only-way-to-endorphin thing, I&#39;ll let that lie. (And just for the record, I have never got an endorphin rush from running.  We&#39;re talking 36 miles per week, and I&#39;ve hated every goddamn step.)  As for the plot assist — well, true.  Ideas come to you, out there alone on the tundra.  And it also helps if your running buddy happens to be a fellow writer with a better grasp of plot structure than you.  But in all honesty, I wouldn&#39;t say that running is the best plot-assist I&#39;ve encountered.  Thrashing ideas with like minds over beers works too.  So does throwing out the chum online, and seeing what you guys have to say...<br><br><b>chang3002</b> said...<br><br><i>As always, I agree with the brilliant Bear. Can you get Eureka in a pill?

For years now, I've been rolling my eyes at the whole "cheating athletes" thing.  Nobody cries foul when someone straps a radical new design of running shoe onto their feet and wins the 440; why is putting something <i>in</i> your body cheating, when putting something <i>on</i> it is not?  Seems to me, if we're truly celebrating the competitive spirit, the dogged determination to win, enhancement drugs should actually be <i>mandatory</i>.  After all, I could train three times as hard as the next guy, show tens times the stickwithitness, and still get my ass handed to me just because the other guy happened to have been born with a body that produced more testosterone.  The only way for such a competition to be fair is for everyone to start from the same point:  juice and suppress all competitors so that they all have the same amount of hair on their backs and the same relative muscle mass.  Then and only then will the contest really reflect the competitive spirit, instead of merely celebrating genetic variation. <br><br>Of course, if you go that far, then you also have to recognise that <i>will to win</i> and competitive drive are also ultimately neurochemical, i.e.  physical, i.e. an accident of nature and nurture.  In which case you either customise every competitor so that they are all physical, mental, and emotional clones, or you  stop thinking about it, kick back on the couch with a cold one, and watch the Incredible Hulks in the weightlifting competition. <br><br><br><b>Nicholas</b> said...<br><br> <i>Also, Vernor Vinge has you all beat (what's that you say?

Unfair?</i><br><br>Nah.  Even less-unfair than the analogous situation in athletics, since the goal of scientific research is primarily to learn about how the universe works.  Sure there's petty competition between labs and egomaniacs, and the Collinses might get all bent out of shape when the Venterses win the Nobel Prize by snorting neurotransmitters, but seriously; if artificially tweaking your synapse count improves the odds of curing AIDS or building a traversible wormhole, what possible excuse is there to <i>not</i> reach for the drugs?</p>

        <p>My reaction is - why be angry or jealous of people who gained muscle and lost body fat by taking a pill instead of laboriously sweating for the result?  It sounds like a reason to celebrate to me.<br><br>Would you agree, fellow science lovers, that evolution dictates  we not waste energy and eat when there is food?  There is no natural endogenous mechanism to inhibit becoming a fat couch potato, other than a very secondary mental calculation that you might feel better and live longer if you *pretend* to run away from predators (treadmill), and *imagine* that the food isn't there(Atkins).  <br><br>Fitness and proper diet in the face of leisure and abundant food is perversely contra-evolutionary. Utterly unnatural.<br><br>If such a pill worked, most everybody wins. It would be a triumph or human invention along the lines of mastering electricity, or inventing indoor plumbing.  Society benefits.<br><br>That said, I'm not advocating death by potato chip for anyone. And I appreciate the fun and value of regular exercise, especially when I put on a form-fitting pair of pants and my bottom still retains some of its former glory.  You get a sense of accomplishment.<br><br>HOWEVER, if there really were a pill without side effects that allowed for safe weight and muscle maintanence, that let life-long fatties or even the merely lazy be fit and live better, why not?  Why begrudge them that?  Think of the diabetes that could be forestalled!  The human misery eliminated!  <br><br>Not to mention all that mental energy and economic power being directed at the weight loss industry, redirected to something useful.<br><br>I wouldn't begrudge anyone such a pill, just as I wouldn't begrudge people a pill to make them smarter.  So what if I am no longer a special little snowflake because I am smarter, or admirable because I am fitter, if we all get the benefits?  Good health isn't zero sum in this case.  <br><br>Of course, the pill won't work that way, but if it did ... let us line our fat friends up and give them blister packs of those puppies for free.  Be thin, my pudgy friends, if it makes you happy!  Have a pill!</p>

        <p><i> Because it is not enough to succeed.

I'd need a more impermeable border to segregate off another person's triumph or defeat, and the cell walls here allow ALOT of transport.<br><br>I was just thinking that a world where everyone was smart and strong would be a better, cooler one.

Kinda like the Olympics, where the champions have been so nearly matched, that tenths of a second can win or lose.</p>

        <p>I'm with Bear on this: despite all the obvious benefits of running, I wouldn't do it if it weren't fun for me, because, well, because I am a lazy bastard fundamentally.<br>Of course I run a little bit and in London where the climate is never inimical to human life whatever the time of year, and whatever the bloody Londoners find to whinge about. (They should try a winter in Padua I say). <br>On the other hand, I am now in the situation where I have to sleep twelve hours a day and still feel cotton in my head or take a nice little pill and start to skip around wholly awake, so I can only say, bring on the pharmaceutics, please. <br><br>P.S. Just found your blog because a friend pointed me at the Vampire presentation after reading Blindsight and wanted more of the same. I work producing powerpoint presentation for Evil Capitalist Bastards day in day out, and I cannot express adequately how much fun it was for me. I tried pointing it out to a friend who's in a depressive phase to cheer her up, but I think I backed out of it early on. Not everybody has the same sense of humor.</p>

        <p>We were talking about this yesterday, and I think my critique could be summed up thusly:<br><br>Changes to body chemistry that rely on drugs or persistent, habitual alterations to blood sugar or metabolism cannot accurately be termed "hacks," because hacks are changes which require repair. The Atkins diet, for example, is not a permanent alteration to pancreatic function -- any Atkins survivor will tell you that the pancreas will still release more insulin when there is more sugar in the bloodstream, and those sugars will still be stored as fat unless used. Similarly, taking Paxil or Zoloft or any of the others is not a "mindhack," because one does not stop taking those drugs -- at least not very quickly. In fact, suddenly ceasing treatment is emphatically contraindicated because it will create, in some cases, an even wilder imbalance of seratonin. Slow re-wiring might be possible (some people do quit their pills, eventually) and perhaps that might be termed a "hack," because it is a measurable change which can be repaired (or shattered anew, depending on one's perspective). However, simply because one has learned to live more happily within the architecture of their own consciousness or body doesn't mean that the architecture has been altered -- one has merely adapted, or found a method to supplement that adaptation, a prosthesis.</p>
