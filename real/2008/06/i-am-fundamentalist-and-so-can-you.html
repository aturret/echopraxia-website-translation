    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This started out as a post about a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=402381&c=2">recently-reported</a> negative correlation between IQ and religious belief (thanks to Craig McGill for the link).  It was going to be relatively restrained by local standards; while it's hard to resist the temptation to rub one's hands at yet more evidence that only Stupid People Have Imaginary Friends, I'd have voiced reservations over the unwarranted conflation of "academics" with "smart people" (believe me, there are as many dumb folks in those hallowed halls as there are anywhere else except maybe Fox News); the use of a single score to measure that multifaceted bag of traits we call "intelligence"; even the sloppiness of some of the third-party coverage (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/12/god_boffins/">this headline</a>, for example, gets the study's findings completely ass-backwards).<br><br>In the end, though, I decided to leave those poor bastards alone and come out of the closet myself.<br><br>I use the word "fundamentalist" in the sense promoted by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindly-Inquisitors-Attacks-Free-Thought/dp/0226705765/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213720963&sr=1-1">Jonathan Rauch</a>:  anyone who cannot seriously entertain the possibility that they are wrong about their basic beliefs.   It applies pretty obviously to Biblical literalists and their ilk, but the term is not limited to them.  It extends to me.  I suspect it even extends to the likes of Richard Dawkins, even though he has stated publicly that he would be willing to change his mind on the subject of God.  All it would take, he says, is "evidence".<br><br>Which is a laudable attitude, and one that reflects the basic difference between science and religion.  The question that's been occurring to me lately, though, is, what <span style="font-style: italic;">kind</span> of evidence would it take to turn me into a believer?  How much would be enough?  God is such an outrageous proposition from so many angles that almost any alternative explanation would be more parsimonious.  Mass hallucination.  Brain tumors.  The Matrix.  Aliens with a propensity for juvenile practical jokes.<br><br>Imagine a scenario in which the heavens literally opened up, and a Big White Dude with a Mighty Beard and a flotilla of cherubim stroking His Divine Genitalia stared down at me through the clouds and proclaimed in a mighty voice,<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:180%;">I, God, exist!  Take your photographs!  Run your tricorder!<br>BELIEVE IN ME!</span><br></div><br>Would I believe?  Fuck no.  This has to be some kind of trick. And no matter how much evidence piles up — a smiley face embedded in pi at the thirteen-trillionth decimal place; a cosmological consensus that yes, there's really only one universe, and it really just does happen to be configured with all its physical constants tuned precisely to permit our existence; the literal appearance of the Four Horsemen — <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of that, appearing in the face of such astronomically-massive odds, would still have to be weighed against the likelihood of the alternative.<br><br>What are the odds that I'm a brain in a tank or a computer simulation, and some bored undergrad is fucking with my sensory inputs?  Pretty damn low.  What are the odds that an entire physical multiverse was created by means unknown by an omnipotent omniscient sentient entity that exists eternally, without any cause or creator of its own?<br><br>Lower.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Way</span> lower.  (Or at least, that model raises far more numerous and substantive questions than it pretends to answer.)<br><br>The bottleneck here is my own mental processes, my own ability to parse input from the outside world, to trust that said input even <span style="font-style: italic;">reflects</span> an objective outside world.  The limits are always in me; the brain contains too many tricks and shortcuts to trust implicitly, especially if it serves up something I consider impossible.  Whatever input is thrust into my face, <span style="font-style: italic;">hack</span> will always be a more parsimonious explanation than <span style="font-style: italic;">god</span>.<br><br>Which leaves me unconvertible, and reduces me to the status of fundamentalist— and Dawkins' grand pronouncement about "evidence" to empty sophistry.<br><br>Sucks to introspect.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a></p>

        <p>Thanks for putting into words what I had thought about for a while now: Every kind of revelation is bound to be a prank.<br><br>My father has a funny story about this:<br>An Indian family moved above his friend's apartment. They used mortar and pestle to prepare food. He asked them to stop doing that because it makes a lot of noise, but they refused.<br>He then asked an electrician friend to build him a transmitter that will operate on TVs. He then pointed it at his superstitious neighbors' TV and said he's God and that they shouldn't be mean to their neighbors.<br>The noise stopped.</p>

        <p>Interesting take. I don't know how i would react, i think there could be evidence that would erode my rock steady atheism.<br><br>Why? Well, It's God. It can do what It likes, because Its infinitely intelligent and infinitely powerful. Indeed, to entertain this thought you MUST acknowledge that It is all powerful, because that is a qualification of being God, and God is being assumed.  <br><br>The point is, if God wanted you to know there was a God, you would. By virtue of being God, It could find a way around all of your explanations--in order for It to be all-powerful, it must be number one in all capacities and therefore able to supersede any other event or parameter that exists, yes? Of course, assuming the nature of the evidence It might provide is pretty presumptuous, but we can assume It would know the evidence was there and, if making a believer out of you was the goal of the evidence, you would be a believer. It's God. It doesn't even need to out think you, what It wants simply is. <br><br>Anyway, that's my reasoning for not being a fundamentalist. God could prove Itself to me if It so desired. The absence of God can not prove itself to religious fundamentalists, though. It's my silly, flimsy high ground.<br><br>Just like so much else (qualia and consciousness come to mind), this whole discourse is bound at the edges by the immutable iron wall of perspective.</p>

        <p>There are some things that are simply unbelievable. I cannot believe in a sleeping green idea. I cannot believe in an omnipotent being. Both beliefs are incoherent. They make as much sense as a square circle.<br><br>In the bible I have a different sort of doubt. I read the book, I thought about it, and decided that there was no way it was true. Not even a little. I could have gone the other way, had the book impressed me.<br><br>But the physical existence of god, gods, divinities, spirits, ghosts, elves, and fairies? I do not pretend to know. Anything that exerts no force and transfers no energy or information probably doesn't exist, but a couple possibilities come to mind. "Miracles" that might give me some funny ideas. But so far every time I've thought that way it turned out I'm made a dumb mistake somewhere... or that some grad student was pranking me.<br><br>I think there are some beliefs I cannot reconsider. But I'm not sure what they might be. How to find out?</p>

        <p>The thing I find amusing is that even if God did exist, I still don't think I'd be a Christian.  Fine... the universe was created blah blah, but I'm still not going to WORSHIP the guy who did it as though I'm some kind of PVC-clad, piss-drinking submissive.</p>

        <p>So assume this cosmological argument isn't total garbage for a second.<br><br>For all we know our benevolent creator really is a grad student who did the universe thing because he was bored, drunk, or horny.

        <p>You've long argued we're all animals, Mr. Watts, and that consciousness -- the 'you' that 'believes' -- is really only solipsism anyway.  So isn't its inability to alter its fundamental beliefs in the face of something so paltry as 5-senses evidence more evidence of its own origins in the non-conscious mind than anything else?</p>

        <p>I do agree that us atheists can probably call ourselves fundamentalists.

        <p>Oh. That's different, then. And it makes it easier to tell what my fundamentals are.<br><br>1: The essential things are constant.

        <p>So, Peter, you would argue that the principle of parsimony can upset our trust in our senses given a sudden influx of highly implausible inputs and that this weighs heavily against any empirical evidence for God that might suddenly appear.<br><br>I've been reading arguments for and against religious beliefs ever since my deconversion over 20 years ago and I thought I'd heard them all.<br><br>But I've never heard this argument before.  And, empiricist though I am, its not a bad one at all.  I had never considered it from that perspective before.

        <p>Good comments on fundamentalism, and an interesting final concession. I see myself as sitting in that same boat of perceptions, though I don't see myself as a Rauch fundementalist.<br>Like most people who've read a thing or two about neurobiology, I consider the human animal far more susceptible to suggestion than most people are aware of. The act of suggestion, simply saying with utter conviction "Hey see that ten-foot-tall purple gorilla over there?" plants visual seeds in listeners' minds. I did this to you just now, in fact.<br>The difference, however, is in how people react or overcome the power of suggestion. I'm a skeptic, thus I question my own reasons for starting to believe in King Purple. The vast majority of people out there, however, simply ACCEPT, as a course of action. Even if they don't initially accept, powerfully ingrained social pressure from people who DO accept often brings the unsure into the fold. Fear of non-acceptance is a brain-smashingly powerful motivation for humans. This is what religion is based upon.<br>If I saw the sky open up and a big, bearded guy in flowing white robes told me to take pictures of Him, I would. But since this has never happened to one single human being ever in the history of our species, not even Moses or Jesus (if you believe Jesus actually existed), I simply don't expect it to happen.<br>But tomorrow's a new day.</p>

        <p>This is a great rant, PW.  I've thought about and worked on this a lot--teaching a course on atheism as I do.  And I think your conclusion--that you wouldn't change your mind--is for the most part right.  But here's my two cents.  I can't imagine any ordinary, or even extraordinary miraculous or paranormal events that would be even slightly convincing that the all being, master and creator of the universe was responsible.  He just wouldn't think that small.  <br><br>If there were a God--which there's not--I figure that human existence would be radically transformed from what it is.  The puny limitations, empirical demands, and the isolated confines of one's consciousness would be transcended.  In short, if there were a God, then we'd just flat be able to know it because things would be so different than they are and we'd have such a direct line on him.  I figure we'd have a direct line on him because an all powerful, all knowing, and all loving being like that wouldn't leave us in the dark or puzzling over it.  <br><br>So in a manner of speaking, I would grant that there are some circumstances, albeit radically alien to our current ones, where it would be reasonable, if that term would still hold up there, to believe in God.  In that universe, we be merged with God, I guess, kinda like Bowman in 2001--all would become clear.  But I have to say that I hate myself for talking that kind of mushy headed drivel.  <br><br>By the way, I'm still planing on using Blindsight as a required text in my philosophy of mind course next semester.  <br><br>Matt McCormick</p>
