      <div style="clear:both;"></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://yuvalstower.blogspot.com/2008/02/no-moods-ads-or-cutesy-fucking-icons.html"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/praise-allah-its-full-of-stars-complete-lolcatish-734577.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Jena Snyder, another <i>On Spec</i> alumnus, posted a minority opinion following my last rant.  This is not the first time she and I have disagreed; there have been sparks and brush fires over the years, and we have not always liked each other.  We continue to see eye-to-elbow on some things (certain traits of the law enforcement community, for example), but unanimity is a poor prerequisite for friendship — and when the sun goes down at the end of the day, we are still friends.<br><br>That is not why I'm singling out her comments for special attention, though.  I'm doing that because I suspect a number of folks might share her doubts and opinions, even if they haven't expressed them here; and because these doubts have some substance to them; and because I believe I can answer them, since I thought long and hard before acting as I did.<br><br>So here, to save you the trouble of hitting your backspace icon, is what Jena said:<br><blockquote>Sure, pissing someone off to the point where they come after you with a gun is a dangerous *act*, but how exactly does a picture of Mohammed in a spacesuit illustrate that the ideas in literary SF are free and unfettered and glorious and dangerous? All it says to me is "Hey, Muslims! Nyah, nyah, nyah, I wave my privates at you. I fart in your general direction." You might as well run a photo of a guy in a spacesuit skinning a live cat - it's controversial, it pushes buttons, and the spacesuit says SF.<br><br>Besides, it's been done. Not the spacesuit, but pissing off the Muslims. It's old, man. That button's as big as the one you have regarding cats.<br><br>If you couldn't win this battle by using a full-frontal attack, then why didn't you try a different strategy? And maybe a literary illustration - how about quotes from Sturgeon or Moorcock or Delany?<br><br>If you really want to take a stand on something, it's a hell of a lot harder to *stand* there and take a beating than it is to turn your back and walk away.</blockquote>There are two issues here.  The second concerns my choice of a specific image and the point I thought I was making thereby, and I'll get to that; but first and foremost is the nature of the AntiVeto Bomb itself.  In the context of this larger issue, the reasons for any particular creative choice are irrelevant:  the whole point of The Bomb was to <i>override</i> such arguments.  The Bomb's very existence is an acknowledgment that there will be times when no agreement is possible; it was intended to keep us from always going the "safe" route in such cases.  Some might point out — some <i>have</i> pointed out — that this means that I could, in theory, advocate genocide or child abuse or animal torture (instead of merely listing the major religions which have done so).  But you might as well ban the use of hammers because I might use one to bash in some innocent skull.  Implicit in The Bomb is the understanding that all those who wield it are responsible, intelligent adults, who will not invoke it for frivolous or hateful cause.  In this particular case Diane seems to have thought that my (attempted) use <i>was</i> frivolous and/or hateful.  I can only point out that a large number of mainstream media outlets did what I only tried to, and as far as I'm concerned that means we're talking about something well within the realm of reasonable disagreement.<br><br>The Bomb was intended to break the bottleneck at such times, and that's how I used it.  For Diane to revoke it simply because she didn't like being overruled shows either a complete misunderstanding of what the device was intended to do, or a contemptuous disregard for that intension.  (She has recently described the Bomb as "bait" designed to keep me from "resigning in a huff", which suggests a little of both.  But she was there when the Bomb was designed, and I've kept her correspondence to me from those days, so I know her description is bullshit.  I also know that she knows.)<br><br>There may be dispute over scope.  The Bomb was designed to counteract editorial timidity:  Diane thinks that should only apply to the selection of stories, while I maintain it should apply to editorials as well.   But these are arguments over minutiae.  The fact is, the only reason I've been at <i>On Spec</i> for the past seven years is because I believed a fairy tale I was told.  The specific conditions that provoked my disillusion don't matter; what matters is that ever since Diane Walton has been General Editor, I have been serving under false pretenses.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue #2:</span><br><br>Why did I choose Mohammed in a spacesuit?  Quite honestly, because I thought that was the <i>safest</i> of the available options.  Does anyone really think that I'd have run into less opposition if I'd gone for an illustration of Sturgeon's incest society, or Moorcock's Jesus-as-congenital-imbecile?  Would a thumbnail of <i>Dhalghren's</i> gay sexplay have passed muster?  What about the more esoteric forms of radical idea-ness, the kind of stuff <i>I've</i> played around with on occasion:  the nonexistence of free will, or consciousness as a maladaptive trait?  I wouldn't have a <i>clue</i> how to iconise such things in picture form.  But by now, pictures of Mohammed are embedded in the culture:  they serve as an immediately-recognizable symbol for "risky territory", even though they're really not any more (or the National Post would not be running them).  "Mohammed + space suit" says, to me, "controversy and science fiction".  I dare anyone to suggest an image that more effectively thumbnails those sentiments.<br><br>Why do we need a picture at all? you may ask. Why not just let my words do the talking? Well, I could do that. But by the same token, one could ask why we need adverbs. Why adjectives? Why should an editorial be eloquent, or lyrically-written? Surely, we can make the point simply, and with minimal verbiage: <i>Speculative fiction is good because it can deal with controversial ideas.  The end.</i>  That says it.<br><br>But it's not very catchy, is it? It doesn't grab your attention. It doesn't engage your emotions. Visual icons are part of the tool set; and yes, you can always drive a wood screw with a dime turned on edge. You don't <i>need</i> to use a screwdriver.  You just get a better end product when you do.<br><br>Am I just "waving my privates" at the Moslems, sticking out my tongue and going nyahh, nyahh, nyahh?  There's no question that some people would find the picture offensive.  But supposing I told you that I was offended by any depiction of, oh, <i>politicians</i> (let's say my religion forbids any depiction of Human leadership because it undercuts the supremacy of the Divine Creator).  Are you sticking your tongue out at me if you go ahead and run a picture of Barack Obama?  Are you waving your privates?  Do you have to bend over backwards to respect every belief and ritual, no matter how stupid, just because it's framed in a religious context?  How many of you cringed, just a little, to see me put the words "stupid" and "religious" so close together?  Is there <i>any </i>religious tic so absurd that we can't ignore it without being accused of intolerance?<br><br>Look:  by definition, <i>any</i> controversial idea is potentially offensive to someone.  And nobody on the planet is willing to admit that they find something "offensive" because it challenges their beliefs; they'll find it offensive simply because, well, it's <i>offensive</i>.  It's against God's Laws.  It's AntiAmerican.  Please, won't someone think of the <i>children</i>!?  Case closed.  And if you question those feelings, or ignore them, then yes:  some will feel the breeze of my mighty testicles wafting across their faces.  But that doesn't make my actions "old" or immature.  It just means I can't be bothered to kneel and scrape before some altar that says we're not allowed to say anything that might hurt anyone's feelings, anywhere.<br><br>People say nasty things about me all the time.  People hurt my feelings.  People even wave their privates in my face.  I've learned to deal with it.  (In the latter case, I've even learned to enjoy it more often than not.)<br><br>Finally, Jena suggests I should have stayed and fought.  How was I supposed to do that, exactly?  Use my eloquent powers of speech to gather popular support?  I did that.  A majority was already in favour of running the picture: Diane told us that OS is not a democracy, imposed her will over ours, and then (ironically) referred to <i>me</i> as a "bully".  She simply shut down any and all discussion.  Am I supposed to grab the purse strings from three provinces away?  Am I supposed to somehow wrest financial control of the magazine back into more reasonable hands?<br><br>Steve tried to heal the rift, before he left.  He tried to be the diplomat, while at the same time making it clear he thought Diane was completely out of line.  Diane told him that I was "a liability", and made it pretty clear that she considered my departure to be a good thing.  So sure, it's harder to stand and take a beating than it is to walk away.   But there has to be some <i>reason</i> to take that beating.  There has to be the chance that some good might come from it.  And the only good scenario I can envision now is one that gives my nose a chance to heal.  And allows me to sleep at night.<br><br>BTW, that wonderful LOLprophet remix at the top of the post is courtesy of <a href="http://yuvalstower.blogspot.com/2008/02/no-moods-ads-or-cutesy-fucking-icons.html">Yuval Langer</a>, and is posted with his permission.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/rant.html">rant</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/writing news.html">writing news</a></p>

        <p>First time I've posted, but I love the blog and the novels (esp. Blindsight).<br><br>Just tangentially, as far as the depiction of Mohammed, how the heck can anyone know what swarthy bearded man in a Turban is or is not Mohammed unless you tell them (or put a big caption underneath stating "The Prophet Mohammed")? For obvious reasons, how could anyone know what Mohammed looked like? After all, with Jesus, even though it's probably not how he actually looked (if there ever was a historical Jesus), we can fall back on centuries of artistic depiction. This could have been Bin Laden in a fish bowl, for all I know of what Mohammed looks like.<br><br>However, that is neither here nor there in the discussion. I believe Orson Welles was once quoted saying (or possibly he was quoting someone else when he was quoted): "The theatre is a safe place for dangerous ideas." It's better to deal with the controversial challenges facing a free society with stories on the stage rather than in riots on the street. Of course, that applies to almost all fiction and should be an element of speculative fiction probably more than other forms and genres. And I doubt there is a safer arena than a quarterly Canadian science fiction digest.<br><br>As far as fundraising, was anyone paying the magazine to play it safe? Do The Canada Council for the Arts or the Alberta Foundation require adherance to any sort of "standards clause?"<br><br>To be honest, from a way outside point of view, I would have to think that this specific argument reached such a boiling point in large part because of the original story rejection that led to the veto bomb. I know that if I had been involved with something like that, I would be wary and waiting for something like this to pop up in the future.<br><br>At any time before now, did you ever suspect that your veto powers wouldn't be respected or honored? Do you think any uncertainty in that regard may have driven you to push this point more than you might have otherwise?<br><br>Either way, does it now even matter if you were bringing some biased expectations into the argument or not? The outcome revealed that the veto bomb did not really exist as promised and as that was the assurance you had for continuing with the magazine, seemed like you couldn't continue.<br><br>Had to be a tough decision, though. Even in the right, fights like these rarely feel like moral victories, do they?</p>

        <p>I read the first half of the previous post, about all those authors I've never heard of and your (I assume justified) pride in helping them with this stage of their careers, and with bringing some good stories to a broader audience, and I thought "I should pick up a copy of this magazine I know nothing of, this "On Spec", and check out Dr. Watt's other, other work".<br><br>Then, I read the second half of that post, and this post, and I've decided I won't bother.  Sorry, all those authors I've never heard of, I will not be reading your (probably excellent) stories any time soon, because I will be avoiding On Spec.  Not that my newly-declared boycott will have any impact at all, since I just admitted I've never been a customer before.  It's a bit like me declaring a boycott of "Martha Stewart Living", I suppose.  Oh well.  <br><br>Thanks for telling us this tale, Dr. Watts, and bravo for your principled resignation.</p>

        <p>I agree with your stand, as I said in my comment to the previous thread, but as you seem to have raised the relative importance of the issue of breach of trust over the issue of free speech in this thread, I'd like to expand what I said a little.<br><br>From the collegial point of view, trust among collaborators is fundamental to the enterprise; violation in a big way, as in this case, abrogates any agreements.  How can you be expected to work with someone who's just revealed that she has lied to you for years about the basis and nature of your professional relationship?  And that she holds your reasons for working with her in contempt?<br><br>I've seen this sort of situation before, in startup companies that were in the process of coming apart.  The people who control the money often have very different ideas of why they work there than the  people who create the intellectual property, and when  bad business conditions start stressing people, these differences can suddenly create fundamental disagreements and dislikes.  Usually, breaking the company up, or having one or more principals leave is the only solution that doesn't involve violence and/or acrimonious legal action.  So your leaving On Spec is probably the best thing you could do for yourself and for the continued existence of On Spec itself.<br><br>I think people who say that you are overreacting to a minor slight have never seen just how  poisonous those sorts of actions and declarations are to  cooperation in a group.</p>

        <p>Well, I've read the posts and the replies, and short of actually checking with the On Spec crew to see about the contractual status of the Cliff Burns Memorial Anti-Veto (which if it was a joke was never a very funny one), this sounds like a righteous exit.

        <p>As far as the first thing goes - Mohammed in a spacesuit - there was no big subtext behind my comment. I just meant the image didn't work *for me* and it made more sense *to me* to use a literary example in a literary magazine.  <br><br>As for taking a stand... Sigh.<br><br>Your comment "In either case, I'm outta there. I resigned on Saturday" just sounded so damn flip, it made me angry. It struck me as "I took my ball and went home," not "I quit on principle." It also took me back to the days when I was the one always forced to find compromises to keep one editor or another - you, Derryl, Susan, Barry - from quitting. <br><br>Back in 1996, long before the Bomb, I wrote an editorial ("Talkin' About the Passion") where I described the On Spec editorial process: if an editor found a story that s/he was truly passionate about, even if the others hated it, passion won, and we bought the story. Where this differed from the Bomb was that the editor had to convince the others that the story met *all* the criteria we were looking for - strong SF element, voice, theme, etc. Above all, it had to be well-written. the Bomb may have been intended to keep us from taking the safe route, but instead, it felt like a threat hanging overhead. By nature, it didn't allow discussion. Yes, the understanding was that we were all responsible, intelligent adults. It still felt like a threat. <br><br>And of course when you invoked the Bomb and you were turned down, you   felt you had no choice but to quit. <br>I shouldn't have been surprised, or angry. <br><br>I am disappointed, though. You and Steve and Derryl brought strong, intelligent opinions to On Spec, and kept the editorial voice wonderfully multifaceted. You will be missed, especially by the readers and the writers who submit their work.</p>

        <p>Some words seem to be missing throughout all this 'a gesture of solidarity'. That picture should have been allowed if for no other reason than that. It being refused tells me that the one refusing was either scared, or one of these politically correct cunts who thinks it's quite right if someone is arrested for laughing at a Moslem's beard but that Moslems demanding beheadings are misunderstood and should be forgiven.</p>

        <p><b>Branko</b> said...<br><br><i>There's no such thing as a hypothetical insult.</i><br><br>... And dammit, that's the very root of the problem, isn’t it?  If someone's offended, they're offended.  Sincerely, righteously, deep down in the bone. They <i>burn</i>, they <i>seethe</i>, and if someone tells them their anger is silly, that doesn’t make it disappear.  It just makes it stronger.<br><br>But you can see that slippery slope a mile away &mdash;  because if offense is fundamentally emotional, then it doesn't have to be defended rationally.  All anybody has to do to censure, control, or silence opposition is to be <i>offended</i> by what someone says and convince enough people that "words are bullets", that hurtful speech is a form of assault and should be outlawed.<br><br>If I try a trick like that on my own authority &mdash; "You cannot use the word <i>mattress</i> because I find it offensive" &mdash; people would laugh me out of town, probably to a chorus of Sealy model-numbers.  But if I clothe my offense in <i>religious</i> terms &mdash; "You cannot show this picture because God forbids it" &mdash; people take the same bogus argument a lot more seriously.   You don't have to show harm.  You need not demonstrate any kind of loss to income or personal welfare.  All you have to do is invoke the disapproval of an imaginary friend, and vast swathes of society will accede to your demands.<br><br>I find it astonishing that our society should treat religious faith as though it confered some kind of exhalted all-purpose free pass, instead of as a neurological disorder.  Only a loon would expect to be tax-exempt because he built a shrine for the worship of elves, but change that last word to "God" and you're away to the races.  And I'm sorry, but allowing that kind of rationale any role at all in dictating what I can say and write and draw is not a concession I am prepared to make.</p>

        <p>I regard editorial interference with an extremely jaundiced eye. Nothing must take the edge off SF.  It's all about boldly going...and all that. The best stories aren't the pleasant or reassuring ones, no, they're the ones that unsettle and anger and peel away layers of preconceptions. No one  should retain veto power or else the rule breakers, the genre busters, the exceptions might not pass muster. The eccentrics and alternative voices would be found wanting...or too extreme. The future is rushing toward us.  There's no time for squeamishness. We have to be able to tell it like it is.  We can't avert our eyes or else it will be too late.</p>

        <p>Cliff, you're oddly right and wrong here. First, the kerfuffle is over a cartoon, not even an editorial, and certainly not over fiction. I agree that this will impact the fiction that we see come out of OS, but your clarion call is pointed in the wrong direction.<br><br>And considering pretty much every other magazine is indeed a dictatorship (quick! Who does Gordon Van Gelder answer to? Sheila Williams?), the concern you express makes me want to reach over and shake you and insist that you start your own magazine and see how long you last before resorting to a dictatorship since nobody else would have the taste you do.<br><br>And then I'd buy you a beer.<br><br>D</p>

        <p>Derryl:<br><br>I see where you're going but it's the mindset I'm talking about. SF fans, writers and readers, often complain that we're not taken seriously, that we're ghettoized and part of it might be because we don't have enough of an edge, we're too safe and mundane in our thematic and stylistic aspirations. Are we addressing issues  or ducking them (in fiction or otherwise)? Are we running from real world concerns, hiding behind FTL and grey goo, claiming the concerns of the present have no role in the future? Are we boring and irrelevant when we should be as sharp as razors? Satire is a scalpel too many of us are afraid of handling, lest we get our fingers nicked...</p>

        <p>I would also add that ON SPEC is a small magazine, trying to survive in a niche market. Government subsidies to help pay the rent. Perhaps one thing that could distinguish it from its competitors is a feisty attitude, a reputation for printing stories and editorials and cover art no one else would dare to. Cutting edge and hip and constantly praised (and condemned) for being ahead of the curve, sharper and more fearless than its stick in the mud counterparts. Canadian SF needs an identity, something to separate it from the pack. ON SPEC could be part of that, consistently pushing the envelope, not shying away from the notion of offending, setting tongues to wagging (and, I'll bet, subscription rolls climbing). But such a tack requires courageous and far-seeing editors, porous guidelines and a fierce, independent heart...</p>

        <p>OK, since this thread isn't entirely dead yet, it's worth bringing up this latest piece of <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080228.wheritage28/BNStory/Entertainment/home" rel="nofollow">proposed legislation</a> &mdash; currently at third reading &mdash; that the Tories are sneaking into law.  Basically, Bill C-10 allows them to withdraw tax credits for any made-in-Canada movie or TV show that an appointed tribunal decides is "offensive".  And since they can't make that call until they view the finished product, that means that the tax credits essential to financing so many Canadian productions can be withdrawn <i>retroactively</i>.  Which means, in turn, that no bank or other funding source is going to invest in such productions, because there's always the chance that vital funding might fall through after completion.  <br><br>This legislation could precipitate the collapse of Canadian filmmaking, on the pretense of protecting our delicate sensibilities from "offensive" content.  (And I would hazard a guess that "offensive" will be defined widely enough to include anything critical of the conservative government.)<br><br>This doesn't apply to funding for the written word.  Yet.  But it's a telling indication of the mentality one must deal with when applying for gummint funding.  It might even make me regard Diane's agonadal behaviour with a bit less contempt, if it weren't so obvious from her own words and actions that she agrees with C-10 in principle.</p>

Obviously, online I can come across more harshly than I intend, and that bugs me because a) it means I antagonise people without meaning to, and b) you'd think someone who makes his livelihood through the use of words would be fluent enough to convey his thoughts and feelings without resorting to LOLs and :)s.  But maybe not.<br><br>Anyway, I know I come across as more antagonistic than I actually am sometimes, and if I've done that in this case then apologies.  But dude, you're not dumb; there's no way you didn't know what you were doing when you used those phrases.<br><br><i>    Telling me I have "problems" hurt my feelings. Btw.<br></i><br>"Issues".  I said you had "issues".  But I wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.  I was just trying to get you to stop with the dismissive phrases.<br><br>You're still welcome here.  'Nuff said.</p>
