Nothing exists in isolation; every object stands in contrast to its background, every thing is relative to everything else.  So when I take a stand in defense of an admittedly pernicious, powerful, and downright idiotic cult, you knows that it is not that I love L. Ron more, but that I love Rome less.<br><br>Specifically, Constantine-era Rome, just around the time of  the Nicene Creeds.<br><br>These <i><a href="http://www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology">Anonymous</a></i> folks have been getting a lot of attention lately.  They <i>hates</i> the Scientologists, my precious, they hates them <i>forever</i>.  They release <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=JCbKv9yiLiQ">Hawking-voiced manifestos</a> accompanied by <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=yozvaMGkDjo">Master-Chief knock-offs</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QubW_LhiqDY">time-lapse cloudscapes</a>.  They tell us all about how bad Scientology is.  They launch <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,141839-c,hackers/article.html">DDoS attacks</a>, and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PkMIhR79ujw">organize protests</a>; they live in the wires.  They are Max Headroom made flesh.<br><br>But what exactly is so bad about Scientology?  What do they do to get people so riled up?<br><br>Well, let's see.  They expect their followers to believe really stupid things about the universe, things that fly in the face of pretty much every scientific discovery ever made.  They extort money from their <s>parishioners</s> victims.  They litigate, harass and intimidate those who challenge them from without; they stifle, brainwash, and (some say) even kill those who question them from within.  They do not tolerate dissent.  They decide how and when women will be allowed to reproduce, strip away a woman's control of her own body.  And they are <i>growing</i>; before long, many fear, they will have their hands in the back pockets of governments the world over.  Who knows how many politicians and power brokers already suck at L. Ron's teat, while some radio-controlled jester gibbers and capers and leaps around on Oprah's couch to keep our attention off the guys loading up the truck in the back alley?<br><br>Is it just me, or are these guys complete fucking <i>amateurs</i>?<br><br>You think the Hubbardheads have political power?  There's a word for the electoral chances of any political candidate who admits to being a Scientologist:  "negligible".  By an odd coincidence, the same word describes the prospects of any political candidate who <i>doesn't</i> admit — nay, <i>proclaim</i> — that they're a Christian.<br><br>Litigation?  The crushing of dissent?  Only pussies run to the courts.  The largest atheist group on the planet — 35,000 members — <a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/1933">just got deleted from MySpace</a>.  They violated no terms of service.  They committed no offense.  But they were found offensive, nonetheless;  some Christians complained.  Now they are gone.<br><br>Not even academia, the self-proclaimed haven of free and enlightened discourse, escapes the shadow.  Wilfrid Laurier University, here in Ontario, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/02/admitting_that_you_have_no_rel.php">just denied official recognition</a> to the Laurier Freethought Alliance because the promotion of "a fulfilling life without religion and superstition" would be potentially offensive to the believers on campus.  (Note that in this case, nobody even complained.  Nobody had a <i>chance</i> to complain, because the whole damn group was aborted before it even came to term.)<br><br>I'm not reading about this in the media.  Feeding '<span style="font-style: italic;">"Atheist and Agnostic Group" AND myspace</span>' into Google News nets me two measly hits.  "<span style="font-style: italic;">Laurier Freethought Alliance</span>"<em></em> gets me none at all.  The only people who seem to even be aware of this, much less give a damn, are the biologists and atheists themselves.  You gotta read the science blogs to even hear about it.<br><br>No lawsuits.  No messy publicity.  Just a few complaints, and *poof*.  As if we never existed.  Now <span style="font-style: italic;">that's</span> power.<br><br>Oppression of dissidents?  Demonization of outsiders?  Institutionalized violence?  Penetration into the highest levels of societal control?  Rs and Ks, there is just no comparison.<br><br>Don't get me wrong.  I've got no more time for the Scientologists than I have for any other religion<sup>1</sup>.  (Actually, now that I think of it, sometimes I have quite a lot of time for the Jehovah's Witnesses.  I even invite them in and ask them questions.  More often than not, they're the ones who ask to leave.)  Superstition is a really lousy basis for figuring out how the universe works.  But going after the Scientologists in a world full of Christians, Muslims, and Trekkies is like surveying a world ravaged by AIDS and devoting yourself to the eradication of the hangnail.<br><br>I don't know who these Anonymous people are.  But I think they should stop picking on someone their own size.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">1</sup><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">There was a time when I would have simply dismissed the whole thing by pointing out that anyone stupid enough to buy into that crap probably deserves to be exploited.

        <p>Mistakes over hundreds and thousands of years take time to correct.  But if you act now we may avoid a million years galactic war.<br><br>We don't rank charities to give, we don't rank evils to fight.  We do what we can.  Like when you see a car crash, you have no option but to help - Tom Cruise.<br><br>Actually Sunny Bono is a house representative who is a Scientology.  Guess what, he was responsible for the Extended Copyright Law, also known as Mickey Mouse Law.  He wanted copyright forever but of course he didn't get it, just extended.  (Sound like their thousand year employee contracts?) They know long ago that copyright was their Hercules heel or their only shield against the SP's.  Bono died in 1998.  His wife Mary Bono completed the law, named after him.  Mary was also a Scientology, took over his seat.  Now she distance herself from Scientology, perhaps just to avoid losing the seat.  The Bono's are often credited for pressuring foreign govt to take it easy on scientology.</p>

        <p>Well, I can't speak for the rest of Anon, but for me, it's all about strangling this one in the crib. Maybe we'll learn something we can apply to the big ones.<br><br>Although personally, I doubt it. The only way to kill Big Religion seems to be letting it rot from inside.</p>

        <p>Contrary to what Fox News would have anyone believe, the last Anon poster is right. 'Anonymous' as a group is about as coordinated as a bar fight.<br><br>While I find myself no fan or proponent of any self-delusion, especially when concerned with the proliferation of knowledge and understanding, I have to take issue with the way that Anon is going about contending with Scientology. By using illegal methods and restrictions of rights (DDoS is basically disallowing free speech on a specific domain, by locking down said domain), it allows Scientology to defend itself legally, where it has proven they have the jack to buy the defenses necessary.<br><br>Instead, the leaking of internal documents (while still might be illegal) is providing a lot more ammunition and weight against Scientology ideologically. A nice start in this area would be: <br><br>http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/tsos/sos.html<br><br><br><br>Scientology rant aside, the basic tools for avoiding exploitation, governmentally, socially, or 'spiritually' is education. It wasn't God that made the lightning because you're a bad boy, it was a natural process that can be explained. It wasn't Xenu that has imprisoned you here, it's your own attitude that keeps you down. It isn't the Pope that should make your moral decisions; you should be responsible for your own. That rock in Mecca? Guess what... its a fuckin' rock.<br><br>Thank you, Dr. Watts, for pointing out the larger threat.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure Trekkies are not a threat to life, liberty or civilization, while Scientology, idk, maybe.  <br><br>But Trekkies are a harmless group of fanciful people who like to dress up like characters from a TV show, from what I've seen.  <br><br>I remember I went to a lecture a few years ago here at the library where I work, and this one was a linguistics lecture on, get this, the Klingon language.  No one attending was dressed like a Klingon, but there were a number of really smart amateur linguists and even some professionals, enjoying the mental exercise of working with a simulated language.<br><br>It convinced me that while space fantasy isn't necessarily a serious endeavor (it won't cure cancer, for instance) it is harmless at worst, and at best keeps peoples' mind free and loose, working in new ways.  I can't agree that Trekkies are anywhere near as dangerous as Scientologists.  :)</p>

        <p>Trekkies don't get tax free donations, indeed any donations at all LOL.  This piss off every tax payers.  I don't need even to debate about Anonymous.  Bottom line - they successfully put the evil ways of scientology on my face.  Tax free?  I thought the cross has something to do with God and Jesus.  No, it's all about xenu and theta-bopping guns.<br><br>Dianna took on the arm dealers because she didn't know.  LRH took on the psychiatrists and drug companies because he had no choice.  Yes, the biggest enemy was themselves.<br><br>The Geeks hate them, using 10 year old tactics, raiding companies to get server logs.  See what happened on Google bombs, digg, etc.  Now the Geeks have the deepest pockets and don't care about Moxon.<br><br>They silence journalists, who will revenge given half the chance.  All big news outlets have reported on Anonymous rather favorably.  Gawker is half Geek and half journalist with deep pockets - go Gawker.  CNET TV even put up Go Anon Go logo.<br><br>Everybody hate lawyers.  Moxon pissed me off big time.  And lawyers hate scientology because they made lawyers look stupid, nobody is afraid of lawyers anymore.<br><br>The list goes on and on.  I can't find any natural allies with scientology.  They are going to blow.</p>

        <p>I do hate Scientology as a whole, a cult, a "religion", what they stand for and do collectively.  "Them" refers to Scientology, not Scientologists, most of whom are victims losing money and everything else.<br><br>Instead of deflecting blame, people take it out on Scientology.  For example, everybody don't like IRS.  They can't do anything on IRS but they can now blame Scientology for their tax exempt status while owning cruise ships.<br><br>The record industry law suits on housewife and students.  They can do anything but they can blame Scientology and keep uploading copyrighted material.  You just can make a difference by uploading a song to share.  But you can by uploading a Tom Cruise banned video.<br><br>Everybody hate frivolous law suits, because low income lawyers just send letters to any small business to blackmail money.  Business owners have to spend more to fight them than settle.  They can't do anything for frivolous law suits but they can easily challenge incompetence Moxon. <br><br>And on and on ...<br><br>By the way, I feel very creepy when I read from the scientology site that they have a private army to response to disasters.  Of course they get thanks afterward from fireman etc.  But that creeps me out.  I was thinking what qualification do they have to be allowed to fight fires?<br><br>It totally creeps me out when the 2nd crazy celeb, the overweight woman who's name I can't spell.  She defend Tom by saying that they do good, response to disasters, go into Red Cross centers to help children with coma.  OMG, what have they done.  How come Red Cross allow them in?  Unsurprised with coma children?  I was looking for the story again, can't find it.  I was going to call the Red Cross (I'm a donor).<br><br>But reading about the stories of ex Sea Org, etc it all made sense.  They are robbing Peter to pay Paul,  getting praise in the process.<br><br>Also all the healing power of COS doesn't make any sense in science.  The FDA can't approve drugs that can cure even 90% of people, while 1% getting worse.</p>

        <p>You know, the Scientology thing is based on the idea that you can buy your way to enlightenment, salvation and joy, which makes it a business, not a religion in the strictest sense.<br><br>In protestantism, for instance, donate whatever you want to the church, do whatever good deeds you like, but that doesn't effect your enlightenment - the causal factor is money-free:  according to doctrine, you have to repent and give your life over to God.

The whole Creationism/ID movement is deeply and systemically embedded in the US educational system; there are enthusiastic movements afoot to water down the teaching of evolution throughout the southern states, and they are usually being spearheaded by elected members of local school boards.

        <p>I asked:<br>Are there any modern religions which require that you *pay* to be in the body of believers?<br><br>You replied:<br><i>Depends on your definition of "require". </i><br><br>Makes sense.

You cannot be considered in the body of believers unless you pony up.<br><br>You offered this:<br><i>A lot of Christian sects take the whole "tithing" thing very seriously.

        <p>Anyone considering the possibility that the "Anonymous" net group or "Project Chanology" might be "false flag" operations in part being conducted sub rosa by or on behalf of either mainstream Scientologists or some splinter or other factional group?<br><br>The tactics being employed may be such that they are intended to garner sympathy or some kind of "defense of scientology" by Anon group or other efforts to take actions that are not only likely to be ineffective, but also to be perceived as offensive, and it may be that the "defense of religion" and freedom of belief, from a mainstream religion or other is the intended goal, in order to try to inject not only publicity and some support for Scientology, but also to synthesize and/or justify a possible backlash, all of which could serve Scientology's more subversive and sophisticated efforts and goals in the long run.<br><br>I also think it should at least be considered, although Anon/Chan are most likely chaotic small time net based efforts, that perhaps we are seeing some other religious denomination demonize Scientology for the purpose of competive marketing or to increase their own "mind share" of the gullible and those in need of or prone to wanting some form of spiritual belief system that is not institutional or mainstream, in order to bring in those who might otherwise gravitate to Scientology.<br><br>Pretty speculative, I know, but religions, including Scientology, have been in internecine psyops and "warfare" long before now, so maybe that's an element of what we are observing. Ask yourself; just who benefits most and least from these kinds of semi-radical Anon or Chanology efforts over time? What purposes are actually served? What are the likely outcomes of these actions and behaviors as this scenario or "us vs. them" mentality and effort unfolds?<br><br>It seems Operation Clambake, and xenu.net, etc., fairly long-term ex-Scientologists and those opposed to the horror that is Scientology (David Miscavige seems like a fairly devious, insidious Svengali or Rasputin type to me), do not support the Anonymous group or Chan, due to their anonymity, questionable tactics, and use of techniques, like the DOS attacks, that are, as one of the commenters here noted, a form of restriction and denial of free speech, even if you disagree with just about everything the Scientologists or mainstream religions teach and stand for, which are primarily negative in history and nature of effects on human culture at this time and long before now. I'd like to see some input on these ideas, if anyone cares to comment. Even if Anon/Chan are not any kind of "false flag" op, their effort and the consequences may just serve that purpose and have that effect anyway.<br><br>Just my 2.13 cents worth of speculation, FWIW. Opinions on these thoughts?<br><br>[Oh, and I agree with the less than literate gentleman 'tax scientology' that Scientology, indeed, should definitely pay their taxes, just like any other profit-making corporation, which is really what they are, as another commenter here noted, they require their "parishioners" (clients? consumers? victims?) to really pay to play their truly absurdist and sick space alien games, as good old L. Ron Hubbard structured the "religion" for pecuniary purposes and as a form of exploitative mind control and crass, power-hungry personal manipulation. IMHO.]<br><br>I'm really glad the Thetan OT VIII, etc. 'secret truths' are out on the net, just so that vulnerable noobs can check that crap out, and if they have any sense at all, stay very far away from the persuasive propagandists of these "new-age" belief systems of exploitation, just as they should research the origins and history of any "mainstream" religious or spiritual false belief system created by man.<br><br>Personally? I'm an agnostic, as even atheism is a basic form of UN/belief in a way, also, when you think about it. An anti-thesis, in a way. As just another human in the world, dealing with the samsara or detritus of the world and existence, and how and why to be a good person, without being hide-bound by some external, hierarchal belief system or "godhead" patriarchal or matriarchal concept that requires my emotional and intellectual submission to some mythical higher power, or that there is or is not any possibility of any non-human basis or "gods" or other "conscious" source as to the origin and nature of the complex multiverse.<br><br>I realized long ago that if you cannot prove a contention one way or another, and be able to establish by evidence some real, testable form of proof, truly, then agnosticism in general, while still seeking truth, whatever that is, or the experiential nature of reality, is my way and course of being and understanding, as it is beyond my personal capacity and means to resolve, and so I don't think any camp (belief) followers [god, gods, no god(s), aliens, or even just the nature of reality in the deepest sense of being able to define the actual origins, nature, or basis of reality causation] have the "real" answers, or that the philosophical and logical conundrum is known or possibly knowable, so I choose life, alone, without attribution or allegiance to any belief system of any kind, based on "deus ex machina" or conscious or directed mechanisms, nor do I reject such out of hand.<br><br>I simply _do not know_, and although I doubt religion, in general, provides any current or valid explanations, as it is primarily a human invention for social and cultural purposes or for getting through life on some level and to be able to "do the right thing," that's the best I've come up with so far.<br><br>I think early man, not knowing what the answers to these questions were either, and being even less able to rationally explore them, created answers in order to fulfill a need for some way of interpreting and relating to the "randomness" of the existential, harsh realities we faced, and still do, of being conscious, imaginative, intelligent beings.<br><br>And so, as Nietzsche once said, man invented God(s) and religion, mainly for survival and sanity purposes. If one cannot relate to the unknown, many find that even an invented or synthesized faith-based "theorem" is better than either nothing or trying to rationally deal with the unknown or unknowable without some firm beliefs as to our origins, nature, and place.<br><br>"Religion" may have been a natural evolutionary development as a form of group survival mechanism, and so to deny the power and purposes, even if in a sense untrue or created, is to deny the obvious, still existent need by most for same.<br><br>Belief, faith, and religion have and do serve many purposes for most in differing, personal ways. Even knowing, in effect, that we don't know, and striving for understanding or knowledge, is sort of a faith-based or "needful thing" in even atheistic or agnostic minds, as wanting and needing to know what's real, or not, is an aspect of what it means to be human, and to possess our kind of intellectual and consciousness drives.<br><br>We want and have a need to be knowing, seeking, and questing for whatever truth there is out there and in us to help make things more acceptable and less unknowable or purely random. That, in one sense, is what it means to be human and alive in the universe. We have a need to know; our efforts relate to "declassifying" or trying to reveal and unveil the mysterious, the unknown, and to refute, confirm, or really seek and need to investigate further the "supernatural" (which to me means the unidentified or unexplained only) in order to know and understand and use that knowledge to further ourselves individually and as a collective species with great potential and ambitions.<br><br>And to realize that potential, as best we can, and again for survival, continuity, and to evolve to higher levels in order not just to survive, but to succeed in realizing that potential and the possibility, as we hopefully can do so, to become truly and more than human.<br><br>I guess that means a form of transhumanist agenda and manifesto is what I'm expressing, while saying that belief and faith are fine, but not at the expense of reality, truth, growing personally and exploring what is, and what may be "out there" and inside of us, from the point of view of a kind of evolutionary enlightenment and necessary change without the old blinders of self-fulfilling beliefs or religious faiths that may hinder that purpose or limit what we can see, do, and know.<br><br>I choose science, a kind of Heisenberg uncertainty principle, rationality, and ambiguity in lieu of fact, proof, or testable, empirical evidence. I am kind of a "reality hacker," I guess. But, again, that's just my take on the matter; I could very well be wrong, misguided, or misperceiving the issues, and admit that possibility, also. Not knowing, and agnostic can do no less, or more.<br><br>As J.B.S. Haldane once said, to paraphrase, the universe is not only stranger than we know, it's stranger than we _can_ know, at least at this point in spacetime, with our primate heritage, and current level of evolution, consciousness, and relative levels of intelligence. The question at the heart of this debate does not have an answer that is acceptable to at least me. Not by any means and certainly not as yet.<br><br>Whosoever claims to know the "truth" of these matters has not as yet convinced me, at least, that they really know what they're talking about. In a sense, I ask myself, how possibly could they?<br><br>And that's not an easy place to reside within, or without, but I can live with the ambiguousness of that quite well, thank you.<br><br>What say you all?</p>

        <p>This article, Peter, could just as easily been titled, "In Defense of Strieberology", considering Whitley's last (allegedly mistakenly posted, and then removed, although still cached) journal entry. <br><br>Here's why: (see first: http://tinyurl.com/yts28n)<br><br>"One essential point being overlooked: his story about a mobile ear implant. Why do I suspect he would not allow an examination of same by medical experts, employing current medical tech such as PET, CAT, and fMRI scanners? Because Strieber is lying or deluded, or both. <br><br>He has now, and for some time since his fiction days (which, imho, continue) been verging in L. Ron Hubbard territory, i.e., fiction as if it were fact merely because the author, Strieber in this case, says so. <br><br>He's trying to pull a Veidt, ala the "Watchmen" scenario. I ask, who will watch (and really vet) this particular watchman? The truth will set him free, but it may not result in continuing profit. Strieber, regardless of the skill and strangely wonderful content of his online journal posts and books, etc., is committing a fraud, whether you or he or anyone else cares or not. <br><br>This can be easily proven. Need I mention this mythical alien or whatever ear (and most eeriely silly) implant, again, folks? <br><br>Critical thinking, honest skepticism, and empirical, deductive logic requires it. Don't get fooled, again! There will be no Veidt confabulations or fakery allowed, at least on _my_ watch, damn it! <br><br>The watchmen are now here, and on the job. Veidt/Strieber will not win this battle for hearts and minds. Nor should be, based on just the facts, ma'am. Feh on him.<br><br>To be continued..."<br><br>The same applies to L.
