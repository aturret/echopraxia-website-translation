	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Most of you here have read <i>Blindsight</i>.  Some of you have made it almost to the end.  A few have even got as far as the references (I know this, because some of you have asked me questions about them).  And so you might remember that old study Libet did back in the nineties, in which it was shown that the body begins to act on a decision a full half-second before the conscious self is aware of having <i>made</i> the decision.  A lot of <i>Blindsight</i>'s punchline hung on this discovery— because obviously, whatever calls an action into being must precede it.   Cause and effect.  Hence, the johnny-come-lately sense of conscious volition is bogus.  We are not in control.  I mean, really: a whole <i>half a second</i>.<br><br>Half a second?  Chun Siong Soon and his buddies <i>piss</i> on Libet's half a second.  <i>Nature Neuroscience </i>just released <a href="http://rifters.com/real/articles/NatureNeuroScience_Soon_et_al.pdf">a study</a> that puts Libet's puny electrodes to shame; turns out the brain is making its decisions up to <i>ten full seconds</i> (typically around seven) before the conscious self "decides" to act.<br><br>Ten whole seconds.  That's longer than the attention span of a sitting president.<br><br>It all comes down to stats.  Soon <i>et al</i> took real-time fMRI recordings of subjects before, during, and after a conscious "decision" was made; then they went back and looked for patterns of brain activity prior to that "decision" that correlated with the action that ultimately occurred.  What they found was a replicable pattern of brain activity that not only preceded the decision by several seconds, but which also correlated with the specific "decision" made (click a button with the right or the left hand).   (Interestingly, these results differ from Libet's insofar as subjects reported awareness of their "decision" <i>prior</i> to the activation of the motor nerves, not afterwards.  Whereas Libet's results suggested that action precedes conscious "decision"-making by a very brief interval, Soon <i>et al</i>'s suggest that actual decision-making precedes conscious "decision"-making by a much longer one.  Bottom line is the same in each case, though:  what we perceive as "our" choice has already been made before we're even aware of the options.)<br><br>This isn't exactly mind reading.  Soon and his buds didn't find a circuit that explicitly controls button-pressing behavior or anything.  All they found was certain gross patterns of activity which correlated with future behavior. But we could not read that information if the information wasn't there; in a very real sense, your brain must know what it's going to do long before <i>you </i>do.<br><br>Obviously this can't be the whole story.  If the lag between processing and perception was always that long, we would feel no sense of personal agency at all.  It's one thing to think that you told your muscles to leap from the path of an approaching bus when the time discrepancy is a measly 400 millisecs; but not even organisms with <i>our</i> superlative denial skills could pretend that we were in control if our bodies had leapt clear ten seconds before it even occurred to us to move.  So I would think this is more proof-of-principal than day-in-the-life.  Still.  As <a href="http://io9.com/379585/your-consciousness-is-ten-seconds-behind-the-present">IO9 points out</a>, given these results, how long before we can do without that stupid conscious part of us entirely?<br><br><a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/04/mind_decision">Wired's online coverage</a> is a bit more defensive.  They bend over backwards to leave open some possibility of free will, invoking the hoary old "maybe free will acts as a veto that lets us <i>stop</i> the unconscious decision."  But that's bogus, that's recursive:  if consciousness only occurs in the wake of subconscious processing (and how could it be otherwise?  How can we think <i>anything</i> before the thinking neurons have fired?), then the conscious veto will have the same kind of nonconscious precursors as the original intent.  And since that information would be available sooner at the nonconscious level, it once again makes more sense to leave the pointy-haired boss out of the loop entirely.<br><br>But I'm going to take a step back and say that <i>everyone</i> here is missing the point.  Neither this study nor Libet's really addressed the question of free will at all.  Neither study asked whether the decision-making process was <i>free</i>; they merely explored where it was <i>located</i>.  And in both cases, the answer is: in the brain.  But the brain is not you:  the brain is merely where you live.  And you, oh conscious one, don't make those decisions any more than a kidney fluke filters blood.<br><br>(Oh, and I've figured out who the Final Cylon is.  For real this time.  Romo Lambkin's cat.)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/blindsight.html">blindsight</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/science.html">science</a></p>

        <p>Well, 10 seconds does seem like a lot.  I agree with you, though Peter: they didn't ask the right question, although you didn't either.  The fact might be that the decision reaches higher level awareness seconds after it is initialized, but the open question is who initialized the decision process?  To say we do not have free will would suppose that the brainstem (or something) is initializing the decisions that are made, but that wasn't the result of the paper.</p>

        <p>It's the brain rehearsing the contemplated action. Perhaps even several actions are modeled and then a final decision is made through a neural consensus.<br><br>And clicking a button is heavily rehearsed. I touch type and thank God I don't have to work out the details involved in hitting each and every button. But I really don't feel threatened by the knowledge that the task of clicking on buttons or performing repetitive  behaviors is given over to a network of neurons in my head. I'm still here and my sense that I am more or less in charge of the important stuff still seems valid to me.<br><br>Peter tends to interpret things towards his own personal biases, just like we all do. However, we really don't know how consciousness "works" and if we don't know something then <i>we don't know.</i> I am the song my brain sings. I am the melody, not the notes and not the paper it's written on.</p>

        <p>Frakking awesome! I have always wondered what the hell was wrong with me when I did certain things and was left confused and pissed at myself.<br><br>But it cuts both ways. "I do not hit. It hits by itself." Oh, the speed. When the mind is out to lunch, the practiced body knows what to do.<br><br>Chun Siong Soon crossed the t's, dotted the i's, yes? He knows when the conscious choice was made? I read the pdf but my eyes glazed in parts. Surely some people didn't hit the button right away but hesitated a bit first. (Not all, and not for 10 seconds, I just want to know how he dealt with that.)<br><br>And *about* Blindsight: I just read Rainbow's End and it didn't deserve to win that Hugo. Nothing against Vernor Vinge - I hear smart people say good things of him. But Rainbow's End was just so.... unsatisfyingly happy.<br><br>Serenity was happy, but they earned their ending. They worked for it. Someone who (may have) voted for Rainbow's End, tell me what I (might have) missed! (Hypothetically speaking. Voting is private, yes.)<br><br>Oh, and the cows... If you've got cheap stargates, I can see interplanetary cow trading. If you don't, I'd rather radio the specs and build frozen embryos from a universal assembler. But Firefly was in a universe where it pays to space pirate bobble-headed dolls. (not much, but hey: people love those things!)

I'm not saying that the <i>brain</i> doesn't have free will (although I'm not saying that it does); I (and more importantly, the guys writing all these papers) are simply saying that going by the evidence, the decisions (free or not) are made by the nonconscious part of the brain.  If you define yourself as all the circuitry in the meat, self-aware or not, then, yes:  "we" are still making the decisions. But if you define yourself as the self-aware spark behind the eyes (which is what most people do), then no:  all we do is get executive summaries of decisions that have already been made, and we mistake those summaries for our own volition.<br><br><b>Brenda</b> said...<br><br><i>I'm still here and my sense that I am more or less in charge of the important stuff still seems valid to me.<br></i><br>Seems valid to me too, but I think the whole thrust of all this research is that what <i>seems</i> intuitively obvious isn't necessarily factually true.

Finally, cats need litter, i.e., soil, and what's a synonym for "soil" or "dirt"?  Given their original machine programming, one can see how a certain literal-minded interpretation of that term would inspire the whole Cylon quest for "Earth".<br><br><b>TheBrummell</b> said...<br><br><i>How is this different from old-school mind-body dualism?

And if you include all your nonconscious processes in the definition of I, then sure;  I say as much above. But the question then becomes, if all these tasks can be done nonconsciously, what's the self-aware homunculus <i>for</i>?

        <p>I absolutely LOVED <em>Blindsight</em> (in fact, I'm re-reading it right now!), but I still find the basic premise that an advanced, tool-using, language-processing species could evolve without self-awareness to be nothing more than science-<em>fiction</em>. It makes for reall cool aliens, yes...but when it comes to reality, it's simply that: fiction.<br><br>The "conscious" layer of the brain's functionality is always a step or two behind "unconscious" functionality, because "conscious deliberation" in moments of life-and/or-death decision-making (such as being jumped by a panther on the primordial plains of Africa) are far too vital to entrust to the "top-level" processing (perhaps even metaprocessing) that takes place in the "self-awareness" module of the brain. Sometimes the brain must simply <em>react</em> to stimuli instantly, without routing that information through higher levels of processing before reacting. That only makes sense. Self-awareness is an important thing that has contributed greatly toward the development of the human species; but self-awareness is only <em>one</em> of many, many brain functions.<br><br>I find the question of "free will" to be an absolutely moot point despite any and all data that indicates a "lag time" between the brain's decision-making algorithms and our conscious awareness of them. There simply <em>is</em> no free will at the basic instinctual level of brain processing: there is only a vast serious of stimulus/response rulesets designed to keep us alive in a variety of situations. "Free will" is a process enacted entirely by the self-aware "conscious mind" abstraction layer, which can formalize decisions and actions which are then passed down through the processing hierarchy to the rest of the brain to put into effect.<br><br>So, the ultimate answer to the question of free will is: we both have it and <em>don't</em> have it. The brain is not one single computer but a series of computers, each of which is responsible for processing a specific kind of information and reacting to it autonomously. The "conscious" abstraction/processing layer has evolved as a means of collecting as much output from these other routines/processors so that we may consciously correlate them and produce higher orders of behavior based on them to increase our chances of survival that much more.<br><br>Actually, I'm working on a review of <em>Blindsight</em> for my own blog which will expand into an essay on just this question of conscious-vs.-unconscious functions in the brain. So thanks for the link! It'll come in handy.</p>

        <p>Just an anecdote that recently showed up in a German newspaper:<br><br>Celebrating her 50th birthday, German chancellor Merkel invited a neuroscientist to her party, say, in place of a stage magician. The guy gave a speech in which he declared that free will was an illusion, and decision making was a hard-wired process involving Neurons.<br><br>A German comedian duo reacted by issuing the statement:<br><br>"German elites were thrilled to hear that not Germans, but Neurons were responsible for the Holocaust. Why the Neurons decided this way back then is not yet known."<br><br>Sure, that's polemic, but it still illustrates the issue at hand quite well: if the human condition boils down to following a set of however complex "physical" rules, there is no justification for ethical behaviour, nor for punishment in the wake of "misconduct".<br><br>My personal feeling is that the current trend towards a "mechanical" explanation of our mental processes stems at least in part from our inability to wrap our heads around the complexity of it all, and the urge to categorize, simplify, which is also one the ideas presented in <i>Blindsight</i>. <br>That's not to say neuroscience is crackpottery - I just have a feeling that, especially in mainstream media, the matter has been somewhat oversimplified recently, and that there's still a long journey ahead of us.</p>

        <p>Peter says:<br><br><i>Can't say I see what is added by putting a bunch of buttons under each finger, if you're only supposed to be pressing them randomly anyway. Still comes down to nothing more complex than left vs. right. What am I missing here?<br></i><br><br>Not a thing!  It's just a thing a person could do at the computer, to get the conscious experience of letting the fingers pick which button. I had been imagining I was the test subject.<br><br><i>The creepy thing about all this is not that our decisions have nonconsious elements, the creepy thing (to me, anyway) is that those nonconscious elements don't seem to leave anything substantial for the conscious parts to do!</i><br><br>I have to agree that it's creepy to think about how much happens outside of *direct* conscious control, but what about this:<br><br>The President of the Land of You is your consciousness.  The President has many functionaries to carry out the tasks for the upkeep of You - a group of upper level management types, to whom the President delegates tasks, and they, in turn, have functionaries to whom the delegate, and so on.<br><br>The President can't meet every cell in You - who has the time?  Plus, the citizen cells are born and die, so he has to assume that under his general edicts and broad mission statements, that they do their jobs.  Likewise, the Pres can't meet every manager or functionary, either.  He/She just sets priorities as best he can, makes adjustments where he/she must, and he gets a free ride in You in return for his organizational services.  I mean, there is a reason they call work of the forebrain "executive functions."<br><br>I think the guys who did this clever study are using too crude a tool to localize "intent" and are demanding that the President go down and help run the backhoes and drive the articulated trucks, when his job is to decide the building needs building, give instructions to the right VPs, and maybe go to the ribbon cutting when it's completed.<br><br>Is your consciousness (yours specifically, you, Peter) less meaningful if it's an organizer and a manager, as opposed to the backhoe driver? It still got the work done, still played its part?<br><br>I think it's even creepier that all the consciousnesses of all your contributors are reaching out magically with electrons and photons and changing <i>my</i> consciousness.  <br><br>I was thinking about this at supper last night, and talked about it with the Better Half - I was contaminating a loved one's consciousness with the contents of brains for which I have never even seen their boney containers.  All you folks have had your metaphorical fingers in my brain.<br><br>That's deliciously creepy.</p>

        <p>Thinking a little more about this, there are many obvious examples of our everyday experience where our actions are out of our control but we don't think of it as abnormal. For immediate example, try to look at this text and not read it as words and letters. Also, I think Peter Watts brought this up elsewhere, the conscious human mind can't hear the word blue and not think of the color blue. We can look away from something or close our eyes, but we really can't choose not to see something we see. On the other hand, if you drop a needle onto a carpet, even though you the light from the needle is striking your retina and those signals are being processed in your brain, you won't "see" the needle until something unconscious recognizes it and puts it in front of your conscious mind.<br><br>Many tasks, typing and driving a familiar route seem to me to be done primarily unconsciously. I can leave work and end up at home with a pretty vague memory of the drive. In fact, I imagine most of us would have a hard time remembering much of our regular activities from just the day before. I think this is because much of the time we are already on autopilot.<br><br>I think this experiment more confirms what we pretty much experience much of the day but don't really "consciously" acknowledge.</p>

        <p>john henning says:<br><br><i>I think this experiment more confirms what we pretty much experience much of the day but don't really "consciously" acknowledge.</i><br><br>Right, that's what I'm saying - when dealing with huge complex events, the brain organizes it into manageability - filters, chunks, and otherwise makes incredible tasks easy,  <br><br>You can't be consciously aware every second what every muscle is doing, just like you can't make sense of all the photons hitting your eyes without the organizational and filtering tasks that begin at the retina and continue as the message tunnels back into the brain.<br><br>I love that the software works so well, and I think the task of deciding and pressing the button begins as soon as you explain to the subject s/he is going to press a button, which precedes the "prediction point" the researchers discovered.

        <p>Here's an interesting article on research into the effect of a belief in Free Will on people's actions:<br><br>http://www.psychologicalscience.org/media/releases/2008/vohs.cfm<br><br><i>Vohs and Schooler set out to see if otherwise honest people would cheat and lie if their beliefs in free will were manipulated.<br><br>The psychologists gave college students a mathematics exam. The math problems appeared on a computer screen, and the subjects were told that a computer glitch would cause the answers to appear on the screen as well. To prevent the answers from showing up, the students had to hit the space bar as soon as the problems appeared.<br><br>In fact, the scientists were observing to see if the participants surreptitiously used the answers instead of solving the problems honestly on their own. Prior to the math test, Vohs and Schooler used a well-established method to prime the subjects' beliefs regarding free will: <b>some of the students were taught that science disproves the notion of free will and that the illusion of free will was a mere artifact of the brain's biochemistry whereas others got no such indoctrination.</b><br><br>The results were clear: <b>those with weaker convictions about their power to control their own destiny were more apt to cheat when given the opportunity as compared to those whose beliefs about controlling their own lives were left untouched.</b><br><br>Vohs and Schooler then went a step further to see if they could get people to cheat with unmistakable intention and effort. In a second study, the experimenters set up a different deception: they had the subjects take a very difficult cognitive test. Then, the subjects solved a series of problems without supervision and scored themselves. They also "rewarded" themselves $1 for each correct answer; in order to collect, they had to walk across the room and help themselves to money in a manila envelope.<br><br>The psychologists had previously primed the participants to have their beliefs in free will bolstered or reduced by having them read statements supporting a deterministic stance of human behavior. And the results were just as robust. As reported in the January issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, <b>this study shows that those with a stronger belief in their own free will were less apt to steal money than were those with a weakened belief.</b></i><br><br>Regardless on the existence of free will, I wonder how changing your belief in free will causes a change in the choices you, consciously or unconsciously, make.</p>

        <p>The experiment is flawed, or, shall we say, that it's an experiment that primarily demonstrates that people, in a situation of limited input, and choices thereof, relegate certain neural activity to parts of the brain below conciousness. For instance, in athletics, there are commonly moments wherein an athlete is confronted, within anywhere from a portion of a second, to a couple of seconds, with an oppositions move, that said athlete was not prepared for, and must then make a decision, within that time frame. The experiment does not cover this. It does not cover the flexibility of the brain or mind, in said situations. For instance, when biking, I am aware of two mental states of awareness and decision making-one, where I have looked up the street, and planned a route, based on whatever traffic is occurring, and the other, when I have to make a decision upon which way to move, in the face of an unpredictable action.<br><br>At best, the most the scientists should say, is that given an environment with specific stimuli-instructions, buttons, freedom of choice and the letters, that they can predict, at leisure, the choice, based on a persons fMRI readings. And only under those conditions. To extend the results of a single study, with no variables (such as different timing restraints, randomized button choices, decision processes based upon the delivery of disturbing stimuli, such as flashing lights and such, also based on button or letter choice)smacks of bias.<br><br>Or how about this: In Ninpo,there is a test, to move from 4th level Dan, to 5th Level Dan. The sensei stands behind the testee, taps the testee once on each shoulder and head with the wooden sword, says "stop", and then the student goes still, and, at the students choosing, moves-always into a roll, one is supposed to avoid the sword blow without use of limbs. The student has no way of knowing when the sensei will strike. No way of preparing, even though he/she knows very well what the instructions are. The button test doesn't cover that kind of thing at all-indeed, it only covers what happens within the booth, with the buttons, and with the letters.<br><br>I certainly wonder where the Godan test sits, in terms of 'freewill' or lack of. The word being bracketed, as mapping systems have not yet adequately identified, and perhaps never will, what, exactly, 'freewill' is. Fascinating, that we are so certain of our tests, surrounding an uncertain term.</p>

        <p>I should clarify a couple things here-first, that I have a suspension of belief concerning the words 'freewill' and determinism', given that General Semantics quite nicely demonstrates that the mapping systems we have, to comprehend those two words, have not been adequately agreed upon-essentially, the words themselves, and the meanings and maps we have for them, are almost meaningless-in spite of dictionary definitions. Well, perhaps that should be described as my own opinion.<br><br>To clarify the other statement, I was thinking of situations more complex than the button pushing, where there are stimuli, unpredicted, that require a complex response-almost a thinking things through, though at a high speed. I'm pretty sure this would, in a lab situation, give a much different type of reading, given the much shorter time frame in which the complex decision must be made.<br><br>My own personal feeling / unscientific belief, personal statement would have to be something along the lines of A: coinage of a word containing aspects both of freewill and determinism, given what little knowledge we have of either word or state, and that the brain and/or mind (in my view, quite interchangeable, though not in the usual mind is by-product of brain function, nor quite the other) and B: that a possibility exists that the brain/mind or mind/brain exhibits qualities and activities that encompass aspects of both free will and determinism, in order to provide greater flexibility. Imagine, if you will, a molecular scaled computer, that exhibits traits of independent decision making, and of deterministic decision making-that appears simulataneously, a mix of concious, and unconcious. To repeat-qualities, and or traits, both of freewill, and of determinism.</p>

        <p>I have to agree that in studies of athletic performance and the testimony of high performing athletes themselves, consciousness or self-awareness actually inhibits performance. The common experience of "choking" is usually explained as the performer become "too conscious" of what they are doing. Trying "too hard" to control their action rather than letting them "flow."<br><br>The entire new performance science of "flow" is based on letting go of awareness to allow the unconscious mind to act since it acts much faster and more reflexively than the conscious. The faster the response, the more likely it was formed UNconsciously since conscious cognition, as we all know, takes longer since it requires our conscious attention.<br><br>For more on this check out Mihály Csíkszentmihályi's book FLOW or Tim gallwey's The Inner Game Of Tennis.</p>

        <p>Peter says:<br><br><i>Quite right.

I love your blog, but I'm too lazy and short of time for a thorough review of your review of the literature, as much as I appreciate the invitation.<br><br>Can't we wait until the neuropsych professionals review the literature looking for studies that don't have a Delegator confound?   <br><br>(My Laziness subroutines are already gearing up in anticipation of a Delegator Decision from the frontal lobes; they're sending up a movie of me with my feet up, and holding a frosty glass of some refreshing beverage.)<br><br><i>Just to clarify: what are you thinking of when you say "general decisions"? ... get laid... find food .... avoid  predators ....ooooh, sugar!...all pretty basic, subcortical priorities.</i><br><br>I was thinking more like "Drive to work" or "read a book."  My personal sense of consciousness is that getting laid, eating sugar, and avoiding predators are suggestions from the departmental layers down the line - they make suggestions all the time, interactively with each other and the Delegator.  It's an interplay between sometimes competing priorities.<br><br><i>And I would argue that a lot of the things we use our neocortices for -- war, religion, art, porn, various-mixtures-of-the-above --  ultimately arise from those basic decisions. </i><br><br>I don't know - war and art are complex. The component mental tasks that go into them are multitudinous, and may be spread across many brains.  <br><br>Even if I believe that suggestions for my next action came from my amygdala, say, there is interplay between the amygdala and other limbic structures, the rest of the temporal lobe, etc, way before I actually, idk, sign up for the Marines?   <br><br><i>Ultimately, I guess I'm suggesting,the brain stem is still in control.</i><br><br>Making war can have multiple motivations, and require the executing of hundreds of subroutines in multitudes of mental departments before I can actually level my neighbor's house with a rocket.   So my amygdala can't do it alone.

You mean "relegated to <i>conscious</i> memory", as you make clear in your follow-up.  And the problem with that is that you're qualifying "memory" with the very concept &mdash; "conscious" &mdash; that you're trying to define.  So your definition is circular:  Conscious decisions are decisions that we consciously remember. <br><br><br><i>When you are training to become an athlete you are "conscious" of every little move you make because you are learning. Every decision must be cataloged. We store these decisions to memory so we can weigh them against the outcomes of those decisions.<br><br>We become "unconscious" of these decisions when we have built a neural net to cope with these activities and no longer need to relegate these decisions to memory.</i><br><br>This is true.  This is how <i>we</i> learn things, for sure.  But does that mean that conscious awareness is the <i>only</i> means to that end?  We already have software that learns from experience— we have neural nets that learn to drive vehicles through sheer experience, and not through any set of innate programmed rules.  We have software that can see a problem in a set of data, formulate a hypothesis based upon it, and actually design the experiment to test that hypothesis.  These are all activities that you or I would do consciously; but does that mean that DARPA cars are self-aware?<br><br>Futhermore, research done just within the past couple of years shows that conscious processing actually results in <i>worse</i> decisions than unconscious processing does; there simply isn't enough room on the scratch-pad of self-awareness to hold all the variables necessary for complex calculations.  People forced to cogitate nonconciously on complex problems (containing upwards of 7 variables) actually do better than those who are allowed to think consciously about the same problem.  So it seems to me not only that consciousness isn't <i>necessary</i> for learning, but that nonconscious alternatives actually do the job <i>better</i>.</p>

        <p>Actually, it's funny that you brought up RAM, because the more I thought about this, I realized that thinking of consciousness as RAM was a very good analogy.<br><br>How many times have you thought of something and had no idea why? Maybe your brain is just storing that image in your head because it needed it to process some calculation. <br><br>The RAM of a computer stores no information about anything that's hard wired. The RAM is also completely uninvolved in the decision making process. And the brain is just a computer that can rewire itself. <br><br>Furthermore, anything hard wired is going to run faster and more reliably than software. So the more hard wired something is, the less the RAM is involved, and the better the performance.<br><br>And I don't have any problem thinking of the RAM of a computer as its consciousness, or self-awareness (whatever that means), provided the computer is intelligent.</p>
