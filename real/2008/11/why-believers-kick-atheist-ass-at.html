	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Here's a fascinating possibility:  that people with religious beliefs are better at pattern-matching than those without.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003679#pone.0003679-Erdelyi1">empirical findings</a> are out of the Netherlands (popsci summary <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16046-religion-alters-visual-perception.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news">here</a>), and are phrased much more conservatively:  when presented with visual stimuli containing two levels of resolution (for example, a big square consisting of a bunch of little rectangles) "Calvinists showed a smaller, but still significant, … global precedence effect than Atheists".  (Basically, they were quicker to recognize the local pattern within the global one.)  Like all good scientists, the authors brim with caveats and qualifiers:  does religion shape perception, or merely attract those with certain perceptual inclinations?  Is this a hallmark of religious belief generally, or merely a feature of the Calvinist eyes-on-the-ground credo of "mind your own business"?  The authors defend their choice of religious group on the reasonable grounds that in a country as small as the Netherlands, there just aren't any other religious groups for whom extraneous variables are comparable; the Catholics mingle too much with the Belgians and the Germans to assume a common cultural context, and Jim Jones' followers never had a significant Dutch component even <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> they were all dead.  Follow-up international studies, encompassing other religious groups, are currently in the planning stages.  In the meantime, Colzato <span style="font-style: italic;">et al</span> admit to being worried about the implications of this whole religion-affects-perception thing:<br><blockquote>…it seems possible that religious beliefs may indeed lead to different and sometimes discrepant and incompatible interpretations of the same incident. That this can happen is a well-known empirical fact but that it can originate in basic automatic visual operations that precede conscious representation is surprising and in some sense worrying — as it seems to work against the scientific ideal that careful observation is sufficient to reach agreements about basic facts and what we consider reality.</blockquote>But here's the thing.  The study focused on whether or not Calvinists had a different "global precedence" effect than atheists, and they pretty much confined their analysis to that question.  But I'm not writing for a peer-reviewed journal here<sup>1</sup>, so I can wander a bit further afield: and if you actually look at the data they present, Calvinists are faster on the draw than atheists on both local <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> global levels; and their error rate is lower, too:<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/journal.pone.0003679.t001-726794.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 303px; height: 320px;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/journal.pone.0003679.t001-726557.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br>So I say, screw this global/local bullshit.  The take-home message <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm</span> reading here is that Calvinists are just better at pattern-matching than atheists, period.  And I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that when Colzato <span style="font-style: italic;">et al</span> get around to testing other religious groups, they'll find the same pattern:  I think they'll find that ass-hamster fans of <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> stripe will be better pattern-matchers than us heathens.<br><br>You shouldn't be surprised by this; we've talked about it before.  A few weeks back — during my <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2008/10/understanding-sarah-palin-or-god-is-in.html">recent infamous dissection</a> of fear, religion, and the Republican Right —I cited a couple of sources describing the increased tendency among believers to see patterns and connections in random visual static, to attribute Agency and Cause where none exists.  And over a year ago <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2007/10/view-from-left.html">I mused</a> about lateral specialization in our cerebral hemispheres, how one half of the brain seems to look for patterns while the other is more pragmatic.  I even raised the possibility that one might deliberately crank up the pattern-matching modules (while giving the pragmatic ones veto power) so that one day we might actually derive legitimate scientific insights from religious rapture.<br><br>So these Netherlandian findings give me hope.  At the very least, they give me a legitimate peer-reviewed title to stick in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumbspeech</span>'s appendix — because it is this exact process which inspires the religious group that figures front-and-center in that book (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bicameral Order</span> by name, " a bastard Jainist sect with one foot in ancient India and the other in the splice-and-dice frankenworks of late-21rst-century neuroscience").<br><br>So today is a day to celebrate my shrewd insight, eyesight, and foresight into the future of the Human experience.  And also to mention, apropos of nothing in particular, that the Dresden Dolls in general and Amanda Palmer in particular absofuckinglutely rock my world.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:85%;"><sup>1</sup> Well, not that you lot don't review it to within an inch of its life, of course.

        <p>Next job: to test whether religious belief affects perception of patterns that aren't there: does the better skill at pattern matching overextend itself?<br><br>Unless you've covered that, in which case I apologize for not paying proper attention.<br><br>I completely agree with your musical commentary - Amanda Palmer rocks. If you haven't watched them, she's posted a number of videos from the new album on YouTube. The dedication of "Oasis" to Sarah Palin made my day.</p>

        <p>I don't see why anyone would be surprised that religious people are better at seeing patterns than atheists.  After all, atheists don't claim to see the image of Darwin or Einstein in a potato chip, and an atheist would definitely not buy one on eBay. <br><br>I don't think that you even have to go as far as major religions to demonstrate this phenomenon.  Elvis fanatics still claim to see Elvis at every turn; conspiracy theorists (a religion all their own) still believe that the moon landing was a hoax and that Kennedy was killed by a second gunman, and they will show you a preponderance of "evidence" to support the argument.  And don't get me going on Jethro Tull fans!!</p>

        <p>Some of the stuff I'm reading for the latest chapter of my thesis relates to how people reading fiction look for cues about romantic/predatory intents among characters, in an attempt to match patterns of behaviour and yield foresight about possible future behaviour (will there be kissing/killing). So this makes me wonder if romance or mystery readers would fall into the same category, somehow, or if they would even be conscious of a engaging in a similar process. (The book's on how autism patients read fiction -- you might like it.)<br><br>Then again, this could just be my Jesuit-trained mind seeing a similarity that isn't quite demonstrable.</p>

Everyone looks for patterns, for concordances and things that match, and everyone then winnows them out according to what is plausible, workable, or likely. <br><br>This study might be catching a group of people who are slightly more adept at the pattern generation, but we should be careful not to take the next step and divide humanity into pattern/no-pattern or global/local thinkers, since people who truly were one and not the other would be highly abnormal.  Schizophrenics generate connections at lightening speed, then are unable to sort and weed out those connections.<br><br>phiala says:<br><br><i>does the better skill at pattern matching overextend itself?</i><br><br>I think this is a good question, because I would imagine that different loading of skills would tend to cause different types of error in problem-solving.  Failure to cleave off pattern matches that were not meaningful is one kind of error, and failure to see pattern matches that were actually there is quite another.<br><br>e.g., anonymous' failure to "to see the image of Darwin or Einstein in a potato chip."  A potato chip might look like Einstein, the question is how meaningful that likeness is, versus what does it say about someone that they couldn't see a likeness that is really there.</p>

        <p>y.t<br><br>I believe that ass-hamster is a reference to the rumour about Richard Gere inserting live hamsters up his ass.

        <p>bec_87rb strokes chin thoughtfully:<br><br>He made a declaration that he did not believe there were giant purple hampsters living up his rectum, and giving him divine guidance.

I once responded by saying that you can't prove that I don't have an invisible purple hamster living up my ass who tells me how to live my life, so Christians are pretty much obligated to believe in ass-hamsters as well. <br><br>In hindsight (so to speak), there are a number of problems with this analogy.  One <i>could</i>, in fact, test for the presence on an invisible hamster up my ass if you could just strap me down on a board and slip on a latex glove; invisible hamsters cannot, by definition, be purple; and no one is claiming in my counterexample that the hamster created the entire universe.  But all of these failings  only highlight the greater absurdity of religious belief; the invisible purple ass-hamster is, in fact, infinitely more plausible a construct than God, and yet people who'd (quite rightly) consign me to the loony bin for such a belief think nothing of abasing themselves before an imaginary friend that makes ass-hamsters look sensible as shoes.<br><br>By a curious coincidence, Stephen Colbert (who evidently teaches Sunday School, and who I suspect would hand me my own ass-hamster on a plate in a debate setting) did a bit last night in which he explained that the DSM definition of "delusion" actually contains a caveat to let religious folks off the hook:  it's not a delusion, regardless of how absurd it is, as long as a lot of people believe it.  (Wikipedia backs this up, for whatever that's worth.)  I find this an astonishingly cowardly stance even for psychiatrists; it assumes that scientific truth is a matter of social consensus.  By the DSM's standards, the belief that the Earth was round would have been delusional up until a few centuries ago; while the belief that it was created in six days, or that all women are descendants of a rib, is perfectly sane.<br><br>Shakespeare was wrong.  The first thing we should do is kill all the <i>therapists</i>. <br><br><i>    Does anyone know whether the nationalist's inability to think critically about his nation is some kind of evolutionary adaptation, such as the inability of people in love to think critically about their mates?<br></i><br>I haven't read any actual research on the subject, but just off the top of my head I'd say it's pretty much the same thing; attitudes that improve social cohesion in a social species will be selected for, all other things being equal.  Fitness trumps truth every time.</p>
