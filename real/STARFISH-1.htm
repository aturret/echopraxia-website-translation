<br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
abyss should shut you up.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sunlight
hasn't touched these waters for a million years. Atmospheres
accumulate by the hundreds here, the trenches could swallow a dozen
Everests without burping. They say life itself got started in the
deep sea. Maybe. It can't have been an easy birth, judging by the
life that remainsmonstrous things, twisted into nightmare
shapes by lightless pressure and sheer chronic starvation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Even
here, inside the hull, the abyss weighs on you like the vault of a
cathedral. It's no place for trivial loudmouth bullshit. If you speak
at all, you keep it down. But these tourists just don't seem to give
a shit.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel Kita's used to
hearing a 'scaphe breathe around him, hearing it talk in clicks and
hisses. He relies on those sounds; the readouts only confirm what the
beast has already told him by the grumbling of its stomach. But
<i>Ceratius</i> is a leisure craft, fully insulated, packed with
excess headroom and reclining couches and little drink'n'drug
dispensers set into the back of each seat. All he can hear today is
the cargo, babbling.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
glances back over his shoulder. The tour guide, a mid-twenties
Hindian with a zebra cut Preteela someone flashes him a
brief, rueful smile. She's a relict, and she knows it. She can't
compete with the onboard library, she doesn't come with 3-d
animations or wraparound soundtrack. She's just a prop, really. These
people pay her salary not because she does anything useful, but
because she doesn't. What's the point of being rich if you only buy
the essentials?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
are eight of them. One old guy in a codpiece, still closing on his
first century, fiddles with his camera controls. The others are
plugged into headsets, running a program carefully designed to occupy
them through the descent without being <i>so</i> impressive that the
actual destination is an anticlimax. It's a thin line, these days.
Simulations are almost always better than real life, and real life
gets blamed for the poor showing. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
wishes this particular program was a bit better at holding the
cargo's interest; they might shut up if they were paying more
attention. They probably don't care whether Channer's sea monsters
live up to the hype anyway. These people aren't down here because the
abyss is impressive, they're here because it costs so much. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
runs his eyes across the control board. Even that seems excessive;
climate control and indive entertainment take up a good half of the
panel. Bored, he picks one of the headset feeds at random and taps
in, sending the signal to a window on his main display. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An
eighteenth-century woodcut of a Kraken comes to life through the
miracle of modern animation. Crudely-rendered tentacles wrap around
the masts of a galleon, pull it beneath chunky carved waves. A female
voice, designed to maximize attention from both sexes: &quot;We have
always peopled the sea with monsters&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
tunes out.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Mr.
Codpiece comes up behind him, lays a familiar hand on his shoulder.
Joel resists the urge to shrug it off. That's another problem with
these tour subs; no real cockpit, just a set of controls at the front
end of the passenger lounge. You can't shut yourself away from the
cargo.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Quite
a layout,&quot; Mr. Codpiece says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
reminds himself of his professional duties, and smiles.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Been
doing this run for long?&quot; The whitecap's skin glows with a
golden tan of cultured xanthophylls. Joel's smile grows a little more
brittle. He's heard all about the benefits, of course; UV protection,
higher blood oxygen, more energy  they say it even cuts down
on your food requirements, not that any of these people have to worry
about grocery money. Still, it's too bloody freakish for Joel's
tastes. Implants should be made out of meat, or at least plastic. If
people were meant to photosynthesize they'd have leaves. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
said&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
nods. &quot;Couple of years.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
grunt. &quot;Didn't know Seabed Safaris was around that long.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't work for Seabed Safaris,&quot; Joel says, as politely as
possible. &quot;I freelance.&quot; The whitecap probably doesn't know
any better, comes from a generation when everyone pledged allegiance
to the same master year after year. Nobody thought it was such a bad
thing back then.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good
for you.&quot; Mr. Codpiece gives him a fatherly pat on the shoulder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
nudges the rudders a bit to port. They've been cruising just off the
southeastern shoulder of the rift, floodlights doused; sonar shows a
featureless landscape of mud and boulders. The rift itself is another
five or ten minutes away. On the screen, the tourist program talks
about giant squids attacking lifeboats during the Second World War,
offers up a parade of archival photos as evidence; human legs,
puckered with fist-sized conical wounds where horn-rimmed suckers
cored out gobbets of flesh.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nasty.
We going to be seeing any giant squids?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
shakes his head. &quot;Different tour.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
program launches into a litany of deepwater nasties; a piece of flesh
washed up onto a Florida beach, hinting at the existence of octopus
thirty meters across. Giant eel larvae. Hypothesized monsters that
might once have fed on the great whales, anonymously dying out for
lack of food.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
figures that ninety percent of this is bullshit, and the rest doesn't
really count. Even giant squids don't go down into the <i>really</i>
deep sea; hardly anything does. No food. Joel's been rooting around
down here for years, and he's never seen any <i>real</i> monsters.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Except

high-frequency speaker begins whining at the abyss.</font></font></p>

clams and tubeworms over three meters long.&quot; Stock footage of a
vent community. &quot;And yet, even at the spreading zones, it is
only the filter-feeders and muckrakers that become giants. The fish,
vertebrates like ourselves, are few and far between and only a
few centimeters long.&quot; An eelpout wriggles feebly across the
display, looking more like a dismembered finger than a fish.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Except
here,&quot; the program adds after a dramatic pause. &quot;For there
is something special about this tiny part of the Juan de Fuca Ridge,
something unexplained. Here there be dragons.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
hits another control. External bait lights flash to life across the
bioluminescent spectrum; the cabin lights dim. To the denizens of the
rift, drawn in by the sonics, a veritable school of food fish has
suddenly appeared in their midst.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
don't know the secret of the Channer Vent. We don't know how it
creates its strange and fascinating giants.&quot; The program's
visual display goes dark. &quot;We only know that here, on the
shoulder of the Axial Volcano, we have finally tracked the monsters
to their lair.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
thumps against the outer hull. The acoustics of the passenger
compartment make the sound seem unnaturally loud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At
last, the passengers shut up. Mr. Codpiece mutters something and
heads back to his seat, a giant chloroplast in a hurry.</font></font></p>

concludes our introduction. The external cameras are linked to your
headsets and can be aimed using normal head movements. Focus and

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Two more thumps. A
grey flash out the forward port; a sinuous belly caught for a moment
in the headlight, a swirl of fin. On Joel's systems board, icons
representing the outside cams dip and wiggle.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Superfluous
Preteela slides into the copilot's seat. &quot;Regular feeding frenzy
out there.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
lowers his voice. &quot;In here. Out there. What's the difference?&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
smiles, a safe, silent gesture of agreement. She's got a great smile.
Almost makes up for the striped hair. Joel catches sight of something
on the back of her left hand; looks like a ref tattoo, but somehow he
doubts that it's authentic. Fashion statement, more likely. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
sure they can spare you?&quot; he asks wryly. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks back. The cargo's starting up again: <i>Look at that. Hey, it
broke its tooth on us. Christ aren't they </i>ugly</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They'll
manage,&quot; Preteela says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something looms up
on the other side of the viewport: mouth like a sackful of needles, a
tendril hanging from the lower jaw with a glowing bulb on the end.
The jaw gapes wide enough to dislocate, snaps shut. Its teeth slide
harmlessly across the viewport. A flat black eye glares in at them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
that?&quot; Preteela wants to know.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
the tour guide.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Never
seen anything like it before.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Me
neither.&quot; He sends a trickle of electricity out through the
hull. The monster, startled, flashes off into the darkness.
Intermittent impacts resonate through <i>Ceratius</i>, drawing
renewed gasps from the cargo.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
long until we're actually at Channer?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
glances at tactical. &quot;We're pretty much there already.
Medium-sized hot fissure about fifty meters to the left.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
that?&quot; A row of bright dots, evenly spaced, has just moved onto
the screen. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Surveyer's
stakes.&quot; Another row marches into range behind the first. &quot;For
the geothermal program, you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
about a quick drive-by? I bet those generators are pretty
impressive.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't think the generators are in yet. They're just laying the
foundations.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It'd
still make a nice addition to the tour.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're
supposed to steer clear. We'd catch royal shit if anyone's out
there.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well?&quot;
That smile again, more calculated this time. &quot;Is there?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Probably
not,&quot; Joel admits. Construction's been on hold for a couple of
weeks, a fact which he finds particularly irritating; he's up for
some fairly hefty contracts if the Grid Authority ever gets off its
corporate ass and finishes what they started.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Preteela
looks at him expectantly. Joel shrugs. &quot;It's pretty unstable in
there. Could get bumped around a bit.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Dangerous?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Depends
on your definition. Probably not.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
let's do it.&quot; Preteela lays a conspiratorial hand briefly on his
shoulder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Ceratius</i>
noses around to a new heading. Joel kills the bait lights and cranks
the sonics up for one screeching, farewell burst. The monsters
outside  those that haven't already retired gracefully, their
tiny fish brains having figured out that metal is inedible 
run screaming into the night, lateral lines burning. There's a moment
of surprised silence from the cargo. Preteela Someone steps smoothly
into the gap. &quot;Folks, we're taking a small detour to check out a
new arrival on the rift. If you tap into the sonar feed you'll see
that we're approaching a checkerboard of acoustic beacons. The Grid
Authority has laid these out in the course of constructing one of the
new geothermal stations we've been hearing so much about. As you may
know, similar projects are underway at spreading zones all the way
from the Galapagos to the Aleutians. When these go online, people
will actually be living full-time here on the rift&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
can't believe it. Preteela's big chance to scoop the library and she
ends up talking exactly like it does. He quietly aborts a midbrain
fantasy he's been nurturing. Try to get into fantasy-Preteela's
jumpsuit now and she'd probably start reciting a cheery blow-by-blow.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
switches on the external floods. Mud. More mud. On sonar the grid
crawls towards them, a monotonous constellation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something catches
<i>Ceratius</i>, slews it around. The hull thermistor spikes briefly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thermal,
folks.&quot; Joel calls back over his shoulder. &quot;Nothing to
worry about.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A dim coppery sun
resolves to starboard. It's a torch on a pole, basically, a
territorial marker beating back the abyss with a sodium bulb and a
VLF heartbeat. It's the Grid Authority, pissing on a rock for all and
sundry: <i>This is </i>our <i>hellhole</i>. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The line of towers
stretches away to port, each crowned by a floodlight. Intersecting
it, another line recedes directly ahead like streetlights on a smoggy
night. They shine down on a strange unfinished landscape of plastic
and metal. Great metal casings lie against the bottom like derailed
boxcars. Teardrop ROVs sit dormant on flat plastic puddles frozen
harder than basalt. Sharp-edged conduits protrude from those
congealed surfaces like hollow bones sawn off below the joint.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Way up on one of the
port towers, something dark and fleshy assaults the light.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joels checks the
camera icons: all zoomed, pointing up and left. Preteela, conserving
O<sub>2</sub>, has retired her patter while the whitecaps gape. Fine.
They want more mindless piscine violence, give 'em more mindless
piscine violence. <i>Ceratius</i> angles up and to port. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's an anglerfish.
She bashes herself repeatedly against the floodlight, oblivious to
<i>Ceratius</i>' approach. Her dorsal spine lashes; the lure at its
end, a glowing worm-shaped thing, luminesces furiously.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Preteela's back at
his shoulder. &quot;It's really doing a number on that light, isn't
it?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's right. The top
of the transponder is shaking under the impact of the big fish's
blows, which is odd; these beasts are big, but they aren't very
strong<i>.</i> And come to think of it, the tower's shaking back and
forth even when the angler isn't <i>touching</i> it</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh, shit.&quot;
Joel grabs the controls. <i>Ceratius </i>rears up like something
living. Transponder glow drops off the bottom of the viewport; total
darkness drops in from above, swallowing the view. Startled shouts
from the cargo. Joel ignores them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">On all sides, the
dull distant sound of something roaring.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel hits the
throttle. <i>Ceratius</i> climbs. Something slaps from behind; the
stern slides to port, pulling the bow back after it. The blackness
beyond the viewport boils sudden muddy brown against the cabin
lights.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The hull thermister
spikes twice, three times. Ambient temperature flips from 4<font face="Symbol, serif">°</font>C
to 280, then back again. At lesser pressures the <i>Ceratius </i>would
be dropping through live steam. Here it only spins, skidding for
traction against the superheated water.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Finally, it finds
some. <i>Ceratius </i>ascends into welcome icewater. A fish skeleton
pirouettes past the viewport, all teeth and spines, every vestige of
flesh boiled away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel looks back over
his shoulder. Preteela's fingers are locked around the back of his
seat, their knuckles the same color as the dancing bones outside. The
cargo are dead quiet.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Another
thermal?&quot; Preteela says in a shaky voice. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel shakes his
head. &quot;Seabed cracked open. It's really thin around here.&quot;
He manages a brief laugh. &quot;Told you things could get a bit
unstable.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh huh.&quot;
She releases her grip on Joel's chair. Fingernail imprints linger in
the foam. She leans over, whispers &quot;Bring the cabin lights up a
bit, will you? Sort of a nice living-room level&quot; and then
she's headed aft, tending the cargo: &quot;Well, <i>that</i> was
exciting. But Joel assures us that little blowups like this happen
all the time. Nothing to be worried about, although they <i>can </i>catch
you offguard.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
raises the cabin lights. The cargo sit quietly, still ostriched into
their headsets. Preteela bustles among them, smoothing feathers. &quot;And
of course we still have the rest of our tour to look forward to&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
ups the gain on sonar, focusses aft. A luminous storm swirls across
the tactical display. Beneath it, a fresh ridge of oozing rock
disfigures the GA's construction grid. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Preteela

out in Beebe Station, you can hear the metal groan.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke lies on her bunk, listening. Overhead, past pipes and wires
and eggshell plating, three kilometers of black ocean try to crush
her. She feels the Rift underneath, tearing open the seabed with
strength enough to move a continent. She lies there in that fragile
refuge and she hears Beebe's armor shifting by microns, hears its
seams creak not quite below the threshold of human hearing. God is a
sadist on the Juan de Fuca Rift, and His name is Physics.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>How
did they talk me into this?</i> she wonders. <i>Why did I come down
here?</i> But she already knows the answer. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
hears Ballard moving out in the corridor. Clarke envies Ballard.
Ballard never screws up, always seems to have her life under control.
She almost seems <i>happy</i> down here.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
rolls off her bunk and fumbles for a switch. Her cubby floods with
dismal light. Pipes and access panels crowd the wall beside her;
aesthetics run a distant second to functionality when you're three
thousand meters down. She turns and catches sight of a slick black
amphibian in the bulkhead mirror.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
still happens, occasionally. She can sometimes forget what they've
done to her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
takes a conscious effort to feel the machines lurking where her left
lung used to be. She's so acclimated to the chronic ache in her
chest, to that subtle inertia of plastic and metal as she moves, that
she's scarcely aware of them any more. She can still feel the memory
of what it was to be fully human, and mistake that ghost for honest
sensation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Such
respites never last. There are mirrors everywhere in Beebe; they're
supposed to increase the apparent size of one's personal space.
Sometimes Clarke shuts her eyes to hide from the reflections forever
being thrown back at her. It doesn't help. She clenches her lids and
feels the corneal caps beneath them, covering her eyes like smooth
white cataracts. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She

on paper.&quot; Ballard smiles. &quot;No pecking order down here,

the rift Clarke is still surprised by the frequency with which
Ballard smiles. Ballard smiles at the slightest provocation. It
doesn't always seem real.</font></font></p>

we should turn the lights off,&quot; Clarke suggests. She knows they
won't. Beebe's exterior floodlights burn around the clock, an
electric campfire pushing back the darkness. They can't see it from
insideBeebe has no windows but somehow they draw
comfort from the knowledge of that unseen fire</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Thud!</i></font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
voice trails off. Beebe creaks slightly. They listen for a while.
There's no other sound.</font></font></p>

must've gotten tired,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;You'd think they'd

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
follows her, a bit impatiently. There are sounds in Beebe that worry
her far more than the futile attack of some misguided fish. Clarke
can hear tired alloys negotiating surrender. She can feel the ocean
looking for a way in. What if it finds one? The whole weight of the
Pacific could drop down and turn her into jelly. Any time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Better
to face it outside, where she knows what's coming. All she can do in

stands facing Ballard, diveskin sealed, in an airlock that barely
holds both of them. She has learned to tolerate the forced proximity;
the glassy armor on her eyes helps a bit. <i>Fuse seals, check
headlamp, test injector</i>; the ritual takes her, step by reflexive
step, to that horrible moment when she awakens the machines sleeping
within her, and <i>changes</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When
a vacuum opens, somewhere in her chest, that swallows the air she
holds. When her remaining lung shrivels in its cage, and her guts
collapse; when myoelectric demons flood her sinuses and middle ears
with isotonic saline. When every pocket of internal gas disappears in
the time it takes to draw a breath. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
always feels the same. The sudden, overwhelming nausea; the narrow
confines of the airlock holding her erect when she tries to fall;
seawater churning on all sides. Her face goes under; vision blurs,
then clears as her corneal caps adjust. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
collapses against the walls and wishes she could scream. The floor of

come out of the freezing darkness, headlights blazing, into an oasis
of sodium luminosity. Machines grow everywhere at the Throat, like
metal weeds. Cables and conduits spiderweb across the seabed in a
dozen directions. The main pumps stand over twenty meters high, a
regiment of submarine monoliths fading from sight on either side.
Overhead floodlights bathe the jumbled structures in perpetual
twilight.</font></font></p>

glances at her wrist thermistor. &quot;Thirty four Centigrade.&quot;

lets go of the rope and launches herself into the light. After a
moment, breathless, Clarke follows.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
so much power here, so much wasted strength. Here the continents
themselves do ponderous battle. Magma freezes; seawater boils; the
very floor of the ocean is born by painful centimeters each year.
Human machinery does not <i>make</i> energy, here at Dragon's Throat;
it merely hangs on and steals some insignificant fraction of it back
to the mainland. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
flies through canyons of metal and rock, and knows what it is to be a
parasite. She looks down. Shellfish the size of boulders, crimson
worms three meters long crowd the seabed between the machines.
Legions of bacteria, hungry for sulfur, lace the water with milky
veils.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
water fills with a sudden terrible cry. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
doesn't sound like a scream. It sounds as though a great harp string
is vibrating in slow motion. But Ballard is screaming, through some
reluctant interface of flesh and metal:</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;LENIE&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
turns in time to see her own arm disappear into a mouth that seems
impossibly huge.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Teeth
like scimitars clamp down on her shoulder. Clarke stares into a scaly
black face half a meter across. Some tiny dispassionate part of her
searches for eyes in that monstrous fusion of spines and teeth and
gnarled flesh, and fails. <i>How can it see me?</i> she wonders. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Then
the pain reaches her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
feels her arm being wrenched from its socket. The creature thrashes,
shaking its head back and forth, trying to tear her into chunks.
Every tug sets her nerves screaming.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
goes limp. <i>Please get it over with if you're going to kill me just
please God make it quick</i> She feels the urge to vomit, but
the 'skin over her mouth and her own collapsed insides won't let her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shuts out the pain. She's had plenty of practice. She pulls inside,
abandoning her body to ravenous vivisection; and from far away she
feels the twisting of her attacker grow suddenly erratic. There's
another creature at her side, with arms and legs and a knife<i>you
know, a knife, like the one you've got strapped to your leg and
completely forgot about</i>and suddenly the monster is gone,
its grip broken.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
tells her neck muscles to work. It's like operating a marionette. Her
head turns. She sees Ballard locked in combat with something as big
as she is. Only  Ballard is tearing it to pieces, with her
bare hands. Its icicle teeth splinter and snap. Dark icewater courses
from its wounds, tracing mortal convulsions with smoke-trails of
suspended gore.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
creature spasms weakly. Ballard pushes it away. A dozen smaller fish
dart into the light and begin tearing at the carcass. Photophores
along their sides flash like frantic rainbows.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
watches from the other side of the world. The pain in her side keeps
its distance, a steady, pulsing ache. She looks; her arm is still
there. She can even move her fingers without any trouble. <i>I've had
worse</i>, she thinks. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Then:
<i>Why am I still alive?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
appears at her side; her lens-covered eyes shine like photophores
themselves. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
dwells on the inanity of the question for a moment. But surprisingly,
she feels intact. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
if not, she knows, it's her own damn fault. She just lay there. She
just waited to die. She was asking for it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's

in the airlock, the water recedes around them. And within them;
Clarke's stolen breath, released at last, races back along visceral
channels, reinflating lung and gut and spirit.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
splits the face seal on her 'skin and her words tumble into the
wetroom. &quot;Jesus. Jesus! I don't believe it! My God, did you see
that thing! They get so huge around here!&quot; She passes her hands
across her face; her corneal caps come off, milky hemispheres
dropping from enormous hazel eyes. &quot;And to think they're usually
just a few centimeters long...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
starts to strip down, unzipping her 'skin along the forearms, talking
the whole time. &quot;And yet it was almost fragile, you know? Hit it
hard enough and it just came apart! Jesus!&quot; Ballard always
removes her uniform indoors. Clarke suspects she'd rip the recycler
out of her own thorax if she could, throw it in a corner with the
'skin and the eyecaps until the next time it was needed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Maybe
she's got her other lung in her cabin</i>, Clarke muses. <i>Maybe she
keeps it in a jar, and she stuffs it back into her chest at night...</i>
She feels a bit dopey; probably just an aftereffect of the
neuroinhibitors her implants put out whenever she's outside. <i>Small
price to pay to keep my brain from shorting out I really
shouldn't mind...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
peels her 'skin down to the waist. Just under her left breast, the
electrolyser intake pokes out through her ribcage.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stares vaguely at that perforated disk in Ballard's flesh. <i>The
ocean goes into us there,</i> she thinks. The old knowledge seems
newly significant, somehow. <i>We suck it into us and steal its
oxygen and spit it out again.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Prickly
numbness is spreading, leaking through her shoulder into her chest
and neck. Clarke shakes her head, once, to clear it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
sags suddenly, against the hatchway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Am

mean&quot; Ballard stops, looks at Clarke with an expression
of sudden concern. &quot;Jesus, Lenie. You look terrible. You
shouldn't have told me you were okay if you weren't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
tingling reaches the base of Clarke's skull. &quot;I'm  okay,&quot;
she says. &quot;Nothing broke. I'm just bruised.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Garbage.
Take off your 'skin.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
straightens, with effort. The numbness recedes a bit. &quot;It's
nothing I can't take care of myself.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Don't

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
steps forward without a word and unseals the 'skin around Clarke's
forearm. She peels back the material and exposes an ugly purple
bruise. She looks at Clarke with one raised eyebrow.</font></font></p>

a bruise,&quot; Clarke says. &quot;I'll take care of it, really.

ministrations.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
looks at her for a moment. She smiles ever so slightly.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't have to feel ashamed about it,&quot; Ballard reassures her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't,&quot; Clarke says, honestly. She doesn't feel much of anything
any more. Just the tingling. And the tension. And a vague sort of
wonder that she's even alive.</font></font></p>

deep sea lays icy hands on the metal and, inside, Clarke watches the
humid atmosphere bead and run down the wall. She sits rigid on her

read what lies behind that glacial facade. <i>Am I bored, horny,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
doesn't answer for a moment. &quot;I don't know, really,&quot; she
says at last. &quot;Privacy, I guess.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
looks up. Clarke stares back, her face neutral.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
I'll leave you to it, then,&quot; Ballard says pleasantly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
watches her disappear down the corridor. She hears the sound of a
cubby hatch hissing shut.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Give
it up, Ballard</i>, she thinks. <i>I'm not the sort of person you

start of the morning shift. The food processor disgorges Clarke's
breakfast with its usual reluctance. Ballard, in Communications, is
just getting off the phone. A moment later she appears in the
hatchway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Management
says&quot; She stops. &quot;You've got blue eyes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
smiles faintly. &quot;You've seen them before.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know. It's just kind of surprising, it's been a while since I've seen
you without your caps in.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
sits down with her breakfast. &quot;So, what does Management say?&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're
on schedule. Rest of the crew comes down in three weeks, we go online
in four.&quot; Ballard sits down across from Clarke. &quot;I wonder
sometimes why we're not online right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
guess they just want to be sure everything works.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Still,
it seems like a long time for a dry run. And you'd think that 
well, they'd want to get the geothermal program up and running as

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
there's something else,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;I can't get through
to Piccard.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks up. Piccard Station is anchored on the Galapagos Rift; it is
not a particularly stable mooring.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
ever meet the couple there?&quot; Ballard asks. &quot;Ken Lubin, Lana

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shakes her head. &quot;They went through before me. I never met any

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nice
people. I thought I'd call them up, see how things were going at
Piccard, but nobody can get through.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Line
down?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
say it's probably something like that. Nothing serious. They're
sending a 'scaphe down to check it out.&quot; </font></font>
</p>

the seabed opened up and swallowed them whole</i>, Clarke thinks.

creaks, deep in Beebe's superstructure. Clarke looks around. The

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sometimes,&quot;
she says, &quot;I wish we didn't keep Beebe at surface pressure.
Sometimes I wish we were pumped up to ambient. To take the strain off
the hull.&quot; She knows it's an impossible dream; most gases kill
outright when breathed at three hundred atmospheres. Even oxygen
would do you in if it got above one or two percent.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
shivers dramatically. &quot;If <i>you</i> want to risk breathing
ninety-nine percent hydrogen, you're welcome to it. I'm happy the way
things are.&quot; She smiles. &quot;Besides, you have any idea how
long it would take to decompress afterwards?&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
can hear it all the way to Beebe; a malign, almost electrical hiss
from the direction of the Throat. Clarke follows Ballard towards it,
one hand running lightly along the guide rope. The distant smudge of
light that marks their destination seems wrong, somehow. The color is
different. It <i>ripples</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
swim into its glowing nimbus and see why. The Throat is on fire.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sapphire
auroras slide flickering across the generators. At the far end of the
array, almost invisible with distance, a pillar of smoke swirls up
into the darkness like a great tornado. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
sound it makes fills the abyss. Clarke closes her eyes for a moment,
and hears rattlesnakes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Jesus!&quot;
Ballard shouts over the noise. &quot;It's not supposed to <i>do</i>
that!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
checks her thermistor. It won't settle; water temperature goes from
four degrees to thirty eight and back again, within seconds. A myriad
ephemeral currents tug at them as they watch.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
the light show?&quot; Clarke calls back.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know!&quot; Ballard answers. &quot;Bioluminescence, I guess!
Heat-sensitive bacteria!&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Without
warning, the tumult dies.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
ocean empties of sound. Phosphorescent spiderwebs wriggle dimly on
the metal and vanish. In the distance, the tornado sighs and
fragments into a few transient dust devils. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
gentle rain of black soot begins to fall in the copper light.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Smoker,&quot;
Ballard says into the sudden stillness. &quot;A <i>big</i> one.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
swim to the place where the geyser erupted. There's a fresh wound in
the seabed, a gash several meters long, between two of the
generators.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;This
wasn't supposed to happen,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;That's why they
built here, for crying out loud! It was supposed to be stable!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
rift's never stable,&quot; Clarke replies. <i>Not much point in being
here if it was.</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
swims up through the fallout and pops an access plate on one of the
generators. &quot;Well, according to this there's no damage,&quot;
she calls down, after looking inside. &quot;Hang on, let me switch
channels here&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
touches one of the cylindrical sensors strapped to her waist, and
stares into the fissure. <i>I should be able to fit through there,</i>
she decides.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
does.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
were lucky,&quot; Ballard is saying above her. &quot;The other
generators are okay too. Oh, wait a second; number two has a clogged
cooling duct, but it's not serious. Backups can handle it until<i>get
out of there!</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks up, one hand on the sensor she's planting. Ballard stares down
at her through a chimney of fresh rock.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Are
you <i>crazy</i>?&quot; Ballard shouts. &quot;That's an active
smoker!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks down again, deeper into the shaft. It twists out of sight in
the mineral haze. &quot;We need temperature readings,&quot; she says,
&quot;from inside the mouth.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Get
out of there! It could go off again and fry you!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
suppose it could at that</i>, Clarke thinks. &quot;It already blew,&quot;
she calls back. &quot;It'll take a while to build up a fresh head.&quot;
She twists a knob on the sensor; tiny explosive bolts blast into the
rock, anchoring the device.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Get
out of there, <i>now</i>!&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Just
a second.&quot; Clarke turns the sensor on and kicks up out of the
seabed. Ballard grabs her arm as she emerges, starts to drag her away
from the smoker. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stiffens and pulls free. &quot;<i>Don't</i>&quot; <i>touch me!</i>
She catches herself. &quot;I'm out, okay? You don't have to&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Further.&quot;
Ballard keeps swimming. &quot;Over here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They're
near the edge of the light now, the floodlit Throat on one side,
blackness on the other. Ballard faces Clarke. &quot;Are you out of
your <i>mind</i>? We could have gone back to Beebe for a drone! We
could have planted it on remote!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
doesn't answer. She sees something moving in the distance behind
Ballard. &quot;Watch your back,&quot; she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
turns, and sees the gulper sliding toward them. It undulates through
the water like brown smoke, silent and endless; Clarke can't see the
creature's tail, although several meters of serpentine flesh have
come out of the darkness.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
goes for her knife. After a moment, Clarke does too.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
gulper's jaw drops open like a great jagged scoop.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
begins to launch herself at the thing, knife upraised.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
puts her hand out. &quot;Wait a minute. It's not coming at us.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
front end of the gulper is about ten meters distant now. Its tail
pulls free of the murk.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Are
you crazy?&quot; Ballard moves clear of Clarke's hand, still watching
the monster.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
it isn't hungry,&quot; Clarke says. She can see its eyes, two tiny
unwinking spots glaring at them from the tip of the snout.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
<i>always</i> hungry. Did you sleep through the briefings?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
gulper closes its mouth and passes. It extends around them now, in a
great meandering arc. The head turns back to look at them. It opens
its mouth.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fuck
this,&quot; Ballard says, and charges.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
first stroke opens a meter-long gash in the creature's side. The
gulper stares at Ballard for a moment, as if astonished. Then,
ponderously, it thrashes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
watches without moving. <i>Why can't she just let it go?</i> <i>Why
does she always have to prove she's better than everything?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
strikes again; this time she slashes into a great tumorous swelling
that has to be the stomach.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
frees the things inside.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
spill out through the wound; two huge giganturids and some misshapen
creature Clarke doesn't recognize. One of the giganturids is still
alive, and in a foul mood. It locks its teeth around the first thing
it encounters.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard.
From behind.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Lenie!</i>&quot;
Ballard's knife hand is swinging in staccato arcs. The giganturid
begins to come apart. Its jaws remain locked. The convulsing gulper
crashes into Ballard and sends her spinning to the bottom.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Finally,
Clarke begins to move. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
gulper collides with Ballard again. Clarke moves in low, hugging the
bottom, and pulls the other woman clear.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard's
knife continues to dip and twist. The giganturid is a mutilated wreck
behind the gills, but its grip remains unbroken. Ballard can't twist
around far enough to reach the skull. Clarke comes in from behind and
takes the creature's head in her hands.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
stares at her, malevolent and unthinking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Kill
it!&quot; Ballard shouts. &quot;Jesus, what are you waiting for?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
closes her eyes, and clenches. The skull in her hand splinters like
cheap plastic.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
is a silence.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
a while, she opens her eyes. The gulper is gone, fled back into
darkness to heal or die. But Ballard's still there, and Ballard is
angry.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
<i>wrong</i> with you?&quot; she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
unclenches her fists. Bits of bone and jellied flesh float about her
fingers. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
supposed to back me up! Why are you so damned  <i>passive</i>
all the time?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sorry.&quot;
<i>Sometimes it works</i>. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
reaches behind her back. &quot;I'm cold. I think it punctured my
diveskin&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
swims behind her and looks. &quot;A couple of holes. How are you
otherwise? Anything feel broken?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
broke through the diveskin,&quot; Ballard says, as if to herself.
&quot;And when that gulper hit me, it could have&quot; She
turns to Clarke and her voice, even distorted, carries a shocked
uncertainty. &quot;I could have been killed. I could have been
<i>killed</i>!&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For
an instant, it's as though Ballard's 'skin and eyes and
self-assurance have all been stripped away. For the first time Clarke
can see through to the weakness beneath, growing like a delicate
tracery of hairline cracks. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>You
can screw up too, Ballard.</i> <i>It isn't all fun and games</i>. <i>You
know that now.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>It
hurts, doesn't it?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somewhere
inside, the slightest touch of sympathy. &quot;It's okay,&quot;
Clarke says. &quot;Jeanette, it's&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
<i>idiot!</i>&quot; Ballard hisses. She stares at Clarke like some

feels her guard snap up again, just in time. <i>This isn't just

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Beebe Station floats
tethered above the seabed, a gunmetal-gray planet ringed by a belt of
equatorial floodlights. There's an airlock for divers at the south
pole and a docking hatch for 'scaphes at the north. In between there
are girders and anchor lines, conduits and cables, metal armor and
Lenie Clarke.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
doing a routine visual check on the hull; standard procedure, once a
week. Ballard is inside, testing some equipment in the communications
cubby. This is not entirely within the spirit of the buddy system.
Clarke prefers it this way. Relations have been civil over the past
couple of daysBallard even resurrects her patented chumminess
on occasionbut the more time they spend together, the more
forced things get. Eventually, Clarke knows, something is going to
break.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Besides,
out here it seems only natural to be alone.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
examining a cable clamp when a razormouth charges into the light.
It's about two meters long, and hungry. It rams directly into the
nearest of Beebe's floodlamps, mouth agape. Several teeth shatter
against the crystal lens. The razormouth twists to one side, knocking
the hull with its tail, and swims off until barely visible against
the dark. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
watches, fascinated. The razormouth swims back and forth, back and
forth, then charges again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
flood weathers the impact easily, doing more damage to its attacker.
Over and over again the fish batters itself against the light.
Finally, exhausted, it sinks twitching down to the muddy bottom.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie?
Are you okay?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
feels the words buzzing in her lower jaw. She trips the sender in her

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
heard something out there,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;I just wanted to

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
switches off her receiver.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Poor
stupid fish</i>. How many millennia did it take for them to learn
that bioluminescence equals food? How long will Beebe have to sit
here before they learn that electric light doesn't?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>We
could keep our headlights off.</i> <i>Maybe they'd leave us alone</i>
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
stares out past Beebe's electric halo. There is so much blackness
there. It almost hurts to look at it. Without lights, without sonar,
how far could she go into that viscous shroud and still return? </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
kills her headlight. Night edges a bit closer, but Beebe's lights
keep it at bay. Clarke turns until she's face to face with the
darkness. She crouches like a spider against Beebe's hull. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
pushes off.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
darkness embraces her. She swims, not looking back, until her legs
grow tired. She doesn't know how far she's come.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
it must be light-years. The ocean is full of stars.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Behind
her, the station shines brightest, with coarse yellow rays. In the
opposite direction, she can barely make out the Throat, an
insignificant sunrise on the horizon.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Everywhere
else, living constellations punctuate the dark. Here, a string of
pearls blink sexual advertisements at two-second intervals. Here, a
sudden flash leaves diversionary afterimages swarming across Clarke's
field of view; something flees under cover of her momentary
blindness. There, a counterfeit worm twists lazily in the current,
invisibly tied to the roof of some predatory mouth.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
are so many of them. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
feels a sudden surge in the water, as if something big has just
passed very close. A delicious thrill dances through her body.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>It
nearly touched me,</i> she thinks. <i>I wonder what it was.</i> The
rift is full of monsters who don't know when to quit. It doesn't
matter how much they eat. Their voracity is as much a part of them as
their elastic bellies, their unhinging jaws. Ravenous dwarves attack
giants twice their own size, and sometimes win. The abyss is a
desert; no one can afford the luxury of waiting for better odds. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
even a desert has oases, and sometimes the deep hunters find them.
They come upon the malnourishing abundance of the rift and gorge
themselves; their descendants grow huge and bloated over such
delicate bones</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>My
light was off, and it left me alone.</i> <i>I wonder</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
turns it back on. Her vision clouds in the sudden glare, then clears.
The ocean reverts to unrelieved black. No nightmares accost her. The
beam lights empty water wherever she points it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
switches it off. There's a moment of absolute darkness while her
eyecaps adjust to the reduced light. Then the stars come out again. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
are so beautiful. Lenie Clarke rests on the bottom of the ocean and
watches the abyss sparkle around her. And she almost laughs as she
realizes, three thousand meters from the nearest sunlight, that it's
only dark when the lights are on.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
only seems a few minutes since she pushed off into the darkness.
Clarke climbs up into the lounge, suddenly chilled.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Where
<i>were</i> you, Lenie?&quot; Ballard demands, coming up behind her.

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a brief silence. It's ended by the sudden, familiar impact of flesh
on metal.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Christ!&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Whatever
it is gets in two more hits by the time Ballard reaches Comm. Clarke

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
comes back into the lounge. &quot;There. Now we're invisible.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
hits them again. And again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Or

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
stands in the lounge, listening to the rhythm of the assault. &quot;They
don't show up on sonar,&quot; she says, almost whispering.
&quot;Sometimes, when I hear them coming at us, I tune it down to
extreme close range. But it looks right through them.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No
gas bladders. Nothing to bounce an echo off of.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
show up just fine out there, most of the time. But not those things.

like ghosts.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
not ghosts.&quot; Almost unconsciously, Clarke has been counting the
beats: <i>eight  nine</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
turns to face her. &quot;They've shut down Piccard,&quot; she says,
and her voice is small and tight. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
grid office says it's just some technical problem. But I've got a
friend in Personnel. I phoned him when you were outside. He says
Lana's in the hospital. And I get the feeling&quot; Ballard
shakes her head. &quot;It sounded like Ken Lubin did something down
there. I think maybe he attacked her.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Three
thumps from outside, in rapid succession. Clarke can feel Ballard's
eyes on her. The silence stretches. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Or
maybe not,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;We got all those personality
tests. If he was violent, they would've picked it up before they sent
him down.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
watches her, listens to the pounding of an intermittent fist.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Or
maybe  maybe the rift <i>changed</i> him somehow. Maybe they
misjudged the pressure we'd all be under. So to speak.&quot; Ballard
musters a feeble smile. &quot;Not the physical danger so much as the
emotional stress, you know? Everyday things. Just being outside could
get to you after a while. Seawater sluicing through your chest. Not
breathing for hours at a time. It's likeliving without a
heartbeat&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks up at the ceiling; the sounds from outside are a bit more
erratic, now. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Outside's
not so bad,&quot; Clarke says. <i>At least you're incompressible.</i>
<i>At least you don't have to worry about the plates giving in.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't think you'd change suddenly. It would just sort of sneak up on
you, little by little. And then one day you'd just wake up changed,
you'd be different somehow, only you'd never have noticed the
transition. Like Ken Lubin.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks at Clarke, and her voice drops a bit.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
you.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Me.&quot;
Clarke turns Ballard's words over in her mind, waits for the onset of
some reaction. She feels nothing but her own indifference. &quot;I
don't think you have much to worry about. I'm not the violent type.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know. I'm not worried about my own safety, Lenie. I'm worried about
yours.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks at her from behind the impervious safety of her lenses, and
doesn't answer. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You've
changed since you came down here,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;You're
withdrawing from me, you're exposing yourself to unnecessary risks. I
don't know exactly what's happening to you. It's almost like you're
trying to kill yourself.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not,&quot; Clarke says. She tries to change the subject. &quot;Is
Lana Cheung all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
studies her for a moment. She takes the hint. &quot;I don't know. I
couldn't get any details.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
stares at her, openmouthed. &quot;What <i>she</i> did? I can't

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

outside pounding has stopped. Ballard does not relax. She stands
hunched over in those strange, loose-fitting clothes that Drybacks
wear, and stares at the ceiling as though she doesn't believe in the
silence. She looks back at Clarke.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Two
meters high, twelve long,&quot; Clarke recites. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
doesn't answer. She punches some commands into a keyboard; the
topographic image dissolves, reforms into a column of numbers. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Just
as I thought,&quot; she says. &quot;No heavy seismic activity for
over forty-two hours.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sonar
doesn't lie,&quot; Clarke says calmly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Neither
does seismo,&quot; Ballard answers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a brief silence. There's a standard procedure for such things, and
they both know what it is. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
have to check it out,&quot; Clarke says. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
Ballard only nods. &quot;Give me a moment to change.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">* * *</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
call it a squid; a jet-propelled cylinder about a meter long, with a
headlight at the front end and a towbar at the back. Clarke, floating
between Beebe and the seabed, checks it over with one hand. Her other
hand grips a sonar pistol. She points the pistol into blackness;
ultrasonic clicks sweep the night, give her a bearing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
way,&quot; she says, pointing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
squeezes down on her own squid's towbar. The machine pulls her away.
After a moment Clarke follows. Bringing up the rear, a third squid
carries an assortment of sensors in a nylon bag. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard's
traveling at nearly full throttle. The lamps on her helmet and squid
stab the water like twin lighthouse beacons. Clarke, her own lights
doused, catches up about halfway to their destination. They cruise
along a couple of meters over the muddy substrate.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Your
lights,&quot; Ballard says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
don't need them. Sonar works in the dark.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Are
you breaking regs for the sheer thrill of it, now?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
fish down here, they key on things that glow&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Turn
your lights on. That's an order.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
doesn't answer. She watches the beams beside her, Ballard's squid
shining steady and unwavering, Ballard's headlamp slicing the water
in erratic arcs as she moves her head </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
told you,&quot; Ballard says, &quot;turn your<i>Christ!</i>&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was just a glimpse, caught for a moment in the sweep of Ballard's
headlight. She jerks her head around and it slides back out of sight.
Then it looms up in the squid's beam, huge and terrible.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
abyss is grinning at them, teeth bared.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
mouth stretches across the width of the beam, extends into darkness
on either side. It is crammed with conical teeth the size of human
hands, and they do not look the least bit fragile.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
makes a strangled sound and dives into the mud. The benthic ooze
boils up around her in a seething cloud; she disappears in a torrent
of planktonic corpses.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke stops and waits, unmoving. She stares transfixed at that
threatening smile. Her whole body feels electrified, she's never been
so explicitly aware of herself. Every nerve fires and freezes at the
same time. She is terrified.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she's also, somehow, completely in control of herself. She reflects
on this paradox as Ballard's abandoned squid slows and stops itself,
scant meters from that endless row of teeth. She wonders at her own
analytical clarity as the third squid, with its burden of sensors,
decelerates past and takes up position beside Ballard's.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
in the light, the grin does not change.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
raises her sonar pistol and fires. <i>We're here,</i> she realizes,
checking the readout. <i>That's the outcropping.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
swims closer. The smile hangs there, enigmatic and enticing. Now she
can see bits of bone at the roots of the teeth, and tatters of
decomposed flesh trailing from the gums. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
turns and backtracks. The cloud on the seabed is starting to settle.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ballard,&quot;
she says in her synthetic voice. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nobody
answers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
reaches down through the mud, feeling blind, until she touches
something warm and trembling.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
seabed explodes in her face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
erupts from the substrate, trailing a muddy comet's tail. Her hand
rises from that sudden cloud, clasped around something glinting in
the transient light. Clarke sees the knife, twists almost too late;
the blade glances off her 'skin, igniting nerves along her ribcage.
Ballard lashes out again. This time Clarke catches the knife-hand as
it shoots past, twists it, pushes. Ballard tumbles away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
me!&quot; Clarke shouts; the vocoder turns her voice into a tinny
vibrato.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
rises up again, white eyes unseeing, knife still in hand.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
holds up her hands. &quot;It's okay! There's nothing here! It's
dead!&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
stops. She stares at Clarke. She looks over to the squids, to the
smile they illuminate. She stiffens.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
some kind of whale,&quot; Clarke says. &quot;It's been dead a long
time.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
 a whale?&quot; Ballard rasps. She begins to shake.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>There's
no need to feel embarrassed</i>, Clarke almost says, but doesn't.
Instead, she reaches out and touches Ballard lightly on the arm. <i>Is
this how you do it?</i>, she wonders.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
jerks back as if scalded.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
guess not</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Um,
Jeanette&quot; Clarke begins.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
raises a trembling hand, cutting Clarke off. &quot;I'm okay. I want
to g  I think we should get back now, don't you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,&quot;
Clarke says. But she doesn't really mean it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
could stay out here all day.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
is at the library again. She turns, passing a casual hand over the
brightness control as Clarke comes up behind her; the display darkens
before Clarke can see what it is. Clarke glances at the eyephones
hanging from the terminal, puzzled. If Ballard doesn't want her to
see what she's reading, she could just use those.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>But
then she wouldn't see me coming...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think maybe it was a Ziphiid,&quot; Ballard's saying. &quot;A beaked
whale. Except it had too many teeth. Very rare. They don't dive this
deep.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
listens, not really interested. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
must have died and rotted further up, and then sank.&quot; Ballard's
voice is slightly raised. She looks almost furtively at something on
the other side of the lounge. &quot;I wonder what the chances are of
that happening.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
mean, in all the ocean, something that big just happening to drop out
of the sky a few hundred meters away. The odds of that must be pretty
low.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.
I guess so.&quot; Clarke reaches over and brightens the display. One
half of the screen glows softly with luminous text. The other holds
the rotating image of a complex molecule. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
this?&quot; Clarke asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
steals another glance across the lounge. &quot;Just an old biopsyche
text the library had on file. I was browsing through it. Used to be
an interest of mine.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks at her. &quot;Uh huh.&quot; She bends over and studies the
display. Some sort of technical chemistry. The only thing she really
understands is the caption beneath the graphic. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
reads it aloud: &quot;True Happiness.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.
A tricyclic with four side chains.&quot; Ballard points at the
screen. &quot;Whenever you're happy, really happy, that's what does
it to you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;When
did they find <i>that</i> out?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know. It's an old book.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stares at the revolving simulacrum. It disturbs her, somehow. It
floats there over that smug stupid caption, and it says something she
doesn't want to hear. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>You've
been solved</i>, it says. <i>You're mechanical.</i> <i>Chemicals and
electricity.</i> <i>Everything you are, every dream, every action, it
all comes down to a change of voltage somewhere, or a  what
did she say  a tricyclic with four side chains</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
wrong,&quot; Clarke murmurs. <i>Or they'd be able to fix us, when we
broke down</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sorry?&quot;
Ballard says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
saying we're just these  soft computers. With faces.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
shuts off the terminal. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
right,&quot; she says. &quot;And some of us may even be losing
those.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
jibe registers, but it doesn't hurt. Clarke straightens and moves
towards the ladder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Where
you going? You going outside again?&quot; Ballard asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
shift isn't over. I thought I'd clean out the duct on number two.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
a bit late to start on that, Lenie. The shift will be over before
we're even half done.&quot; Ballard's eyes dart away again. This time
Clarke follows the glance to the full-length mirror on the far wall. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
sees nothing of particular interest there. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'll
work late.&quot; Clarke grabs the railing, swings her foot onto the
top rung.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie,&quot;
Ballard says, and Clarke swears she hears a tremor in that voice. She
looks back, but the other woman is moving to Comm. &quot;Well, I'm
afraid I can't go with you,&quot; she's saying. &quot;I'm in the
middle of debugging one of the telemetry routines.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
fine,&quot; Clarke says. She feels the tension starting to rise.
Beebe is shrinking again. She starts down the ladder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Are
you sure you're okay going out alone? Maybe you should wait until
tomorrow.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
I'm okay.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
remember to keep your receiver open. I don't want you getting lost on
me again&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
is in the wetroom. She climbs into the airlock and runs through the
ritual. It no longer feels like drowning. It feels like being born
again.</font></font></p>

awakens into darkness, and the sound of weeping. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
lies there for a few minutes, confused and uncertain. The sobs come
from all sides, soft but omnipresent in Beebe's resonant shell. She
hears nothing else except her own heartbeat.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
afraid. She's not sure why. She wishes the sounds would go away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
rolls off her bunk and fumbles at the hatch. It opens into a
semi-darkened corridor; meager light escapes from the lounge at one
end. The sounds come from the other direction, from deepening
darkness. She follows them through an infestation of pipes and
conduits. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard's
quarters. The hatch is open. An emerald readout sparkles in the

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ballard,&quot;
Clarke says softly. She doesn't want to go in.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
shadow moves, seems to look up at her. &quot;Why won't you show it?&quot;
it says, its voice pleading. </font></font>

frowns in the darkness. &quot;Show what?&quot; </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Of

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't understand,&quot; Clarke whispers. Claustrophobia begins to
stir in her, restless again. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
snorts, but the derision seems forced. &quot;Oh, you understand all
right. You think this is some sort of competition, you think if you
can just keep it all inside you'll win somehow  but it isn't
like that at all, Lenie, it isn't helping to keep it hidden like
this, we've got to be able to trust each other down here or we're
lost&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shifts slightly on the bunk. Clarke's eyes, enhanced by the caps, can
pick out some details now; rough edges embroider Ballard's
silhouette, the folds and creases of normal clothing, unbuttoned to
the waist. She thinks of a cadaver, half-dissected, rising on the
table to mourn its own mutilation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

can't you just admit&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
I don't, I  I <i>hate</i> it in here. It's like Beebe's going
to  to clench around me. And all I can do is wait for it to
happen.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
nods in the darkness. &quot;Yes, yes, I know what you mean.&quot; She
seems somehow encouraged by Clarke's admission. &quot;And no matter
how much you tell yourself&quot; She stops. &quot;You hate it
<i>in here?</i>&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Did
I say something wrong?</i> Clarke wonders.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Outside
is hardly any better, you know,&quot; Ballard says. &quot;Outside is
even worse! There's mudslides and smokers and giant fish trying to
eat you all the time, you can't possibly  but  you
don't mind all that, do you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somehow,
her tone has turned accusing. Clarke shrugs.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,
you don't,&quot; Ballard is speaking slowly now. Her voice drops to a
whisper: &quot;You actually <i>like</i> it out there. Don't you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Reluctantly,
Clarke nods. &quot;Yeah. I guess so.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
it's so  the rift can kill you, Lenie. It can kill <i>us</i>.
A hundred different ways. Doesn't that scare you?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know. I don't think about it much. I guess it does, sort of.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
why are you so happy out there?&quot; Ballard cries. &quot;It doesn't
make any sense...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I'm
not exactly 'happy'</i>, Clarke thinks. &quot;I don't know. It's not
that weird, lots of people do dangerous things. What about
free-fallers? What about mountain climbers?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
Ballard doesn't answer. Her silhouette has grown rigid on the bed.
Suddenly, she reaches over and turns on the cubby light.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke blinks against the sudden brightness. Then the room dims as
her eyecaps darken.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Jesus
Christ!&quot; Ballard shouts at her. &quot;You <i>sleep</i> in that
fucking costume now?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
something else Clarke hasn't thought about. It just seems easier.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;All
this time I've been pouring my heart out to you and you've been
wearing that <i>machine's</i> face! You don't even have the decency
to show me your goddamned <i>eyes</i>!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
steps back, startled. Ballard rises from the bed and takes a single
step forward. &quot;To think you could actually pass for human before
they gave you that suit! Why don't you go find something to play with
out in your fucking ocean!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
slams the hatch in Clarke's face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke stares at the sealed bulkhead for a few moments. Her face, she
knows, is calm. Her face is usually calm. But she stands there,
unmoving, until the cringing thing inside of her unfolds a little.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,&quot;
she says at last, very softly. &quot;I guess I will.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">* * *</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
is waiting for her as she emerges from the airlock. &quot;Lenie,&quot;
she says quietly, &quot;we have to talk. It's important.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
bends over and removes her fins. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
here. In my cubby.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks at her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Please.&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
starts up the ladder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Aren't
you going to take&quot; Ballard stops as Clarke looks down.
&quot;Never mind. It's okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
ascend into the lounge. Ballard takes the lead. Clarke follows her
down the corridor and into her cabin. Ballard dogs the hatch and sits
on her bunk, leaving room for Clarke.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks around the cramped space. Ballard has curtained over the
mirrored bulkhead with a spare sheet.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
pats the bed beside her. &quot;Come on, Lenie. Sit down.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Reluctantly,
Clarke sits. Ballard's sudden kindness confuses her. Ballard hasn't
acted this way since...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>...Since
she had the upper hand.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;might
not be easy for you to hear,&quot; Ballard is saying, &quot;but we
have to get you off the rift. They shouldn't have put you down here
in the first place.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
doesn't reply.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Remember
the tests they gave us?&quot; Ballard continues. &quot;They measured
our tolerance to stress; confinement, prolonged isolation, chronic
physical danger, that sort of thing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
nods slightly. &quot;So?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So,&quot;
says Ballard, &quot;Did you think for a moment they'd test for those
qualities without knowing what sort of person would have them? Or how
they got to be that way?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Inside,
Clarke goes very still. Outside, nothing changes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
leans forward a bit. &quot;Remember what you said? About mountain
climbers, and free-fallers, and why people deliberately do dangerous
things? I've been reading up, Lenie. Ever since I got to know you
I've been reading up&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Got
to know me?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;and
do you know what thrillseekers have in common? They all say that you
haven't lived until you've nearly died. They need the danger. It
gives them a rush.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>You
don't know me at all</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Some
of them are combat veterans, some were hostages for long periods,
some just spent a lot of time in dead zones for one reason or
another. And a lot of the really compulsive ones&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Nobody
knows me.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;the
ones who can't be happy unless they're on the edge, all the time 
a lot of them got started early, Lenie. When they were just children.
And you, I bet you don't even like being touched&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Go
away.</i> <i>Go away.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
puts her hand on Clarke's shoulder. &quot;How long were you abused,
Lenie?&quot; she asks gently. &quot;How many years?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shrugs off the hand and does not answer. <i>He didn't mean any harm.</i>
She shifts on the bunk, turning away slightly. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
it, isn't it? You don't just have a tolerance to trauma, Lenie.
You've got an <i>addiction</i> to it. Don't you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
only takes Clarke a moment to recover. The 'skin, the eyecaps make it
easier. She turns calmly back to Ballard. She even smiles a little.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Abused</i>,&quot;
she says. &quot;Now <i>there's</i> a quaint term. Thought it died out
after the witch-hunts. You some sort of history buff, Jeanette?&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There's
a mechanism,&quot; Ballard tells her. &quot;I've been reading about
it. Do you know how the brain handles stress, Lenie? It dumps all
sorts of addictive stimulants into the bloodstream. Beta-endorphins,
opioids. If it happens often enough, for long enough, you get hooked.
You can't help it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
feels a sound in her throat, a jagged coughing noise a bit like
tearing metal. After a moment, she recognizes it as laughter.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not making it up!&quot; Ballard insists. &quot;You can look it up
yourself if you don't believe me! Don't you know how many abused
children spend their whole lives hooked on wife beaters or
self-mutilation or free-fall&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
it makes them happy, is that it?&quot; Clarke says, still smiling.
&quot;They <i>enjoy</i> getting raped, or punched out, or&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,
of course you're not happy! But what <i>you</i> feel, that's probably
the closest you've ever come. So you confuse the two, you look for
stress anywhere you can find it. It's physiological addiction, Lenie.
You ask for it. You always asked for it.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
ask for it.</i> Ballard's been reading, and Ballard knows: Life is
pure electrochemistry. No use explaining how it <i>feels.</i> No use
explaining that there are far worse things than being beaten up.
There are even worse things than being held down and raped by your
own father. There are the times between, when nothing happens at all.
When he leaves you alone, and you don't know for how long. You sit
across the table from him, forcing yourself to eat while your bruised
insides try to knit themselves back together; and he pats you on the
head and smiles at you, and you know the reprieve's already lasted
too long, he's going to come for you tonight, or tomorrow, or maybe
the next day.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Of
course I asked for it.</i> <i>How else could I get it over with?</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Listen.&quot;
Clarke shakes her head. &quot;I&quot; But it's hard to talk,
suddenly. She knows what she wants to say; Ballard's not the only one
who reads. Ballard can't see it through a lifetime of fulfilled
expectations, but there's nothing special about what happened to
Lenie Clarke. Baboons and lions kill their own young. Male
sticklebacks beat up their mates. Even <i>insects </i>rape. It's not
abuse, really, it's just biology. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she can't say it aloud, for some reason. She tries, and she tries,
but in the end all that comes out is a challenge that sounds almost
childish:</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
you know <i>anything</i>?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sure
I do, Lenie. I know you're hooked on your own pain, and so you go out
there and keep daring the rift to kill you, and eventually it will,
don't you see? That's why you shouldn't be here. That's why we have
to get you back.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stands up. &quot;I'm not going back.&quot; She turns to the hatch.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
reaches out toward her. &quot;Listen, you've got to stay and hear me
out. There's more.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks down at her with complete indifference. &quot;Thanks for your
concern. But I don't have to stay. I can leave any time I want to.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
go out there now and you'll give everything away, they're watching
us! Haven't you figured it out <i>yet</i>?&quot; Ballard's voice is
rising. &quot;Listen, they <i>knew</i> about you! They were <i>looking</i>
for someone like you! They've been testing us, they don't know yet
what kind of person works out better down here, so they're watching
and waiting to see who cracks first! This whole program is still
experimental, can't you see that? Everyone they've sent down 
you, me, Ken Lubin and Lana Cheung, it's all part of some
cold-blooded test&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
you're failing it,&quot; Clarke says softly. &quot;I see.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
<i>using</i> us, Lenie<i>don't go out there!</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard's
fingers grasp at Clarke like the suckers of an octopus. Clarke pushes
them away. She undogs the hatch and pushes it open. She hears Ballard
rising behind her. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>You're
sick!</i>&quot; Ballard screams. Something smashes into the back of
Clarke's head. She goes sprawling out into the corridor. One arm
smacks painfully against a cluster of pipes as she falls.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
rolls to one side and raises her arms to protect herself. But Ballard
just steps over her and stalks into the lounge.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I'm
not afraid,</i> Clarke notes, getting to her feet. <i>She hit me, and
I'm not afraid.</i> <i>Isn't that odd</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From
somewhere nearby, the sound of shattering glass.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard's
shouting in the lounge. &quot;The experiment's over! Come on out, you
fucking ghouls!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
follows the corridor, steps out of it. Pieces of the lounge mirror
hang like great jagged stalactites in their frame. Splashes of glass
litter the floor.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">On
the wall, behind the broken mirror, a fisheye lens takes in every
corner of the room.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
is staring into it. &quot;Did you hear me? I'm not playing your
stupid games any more! I'm through performing!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
quartzite lens stares back impassively.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>So
you were right</i>, Clarke muses. She remembers the sheet in
Ballard's cubby. <i>You figured it out, you found the pickups in your
own cubby, and Ballard, my dear friend, you didn't tell me.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>How
long have you known?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
looks around, sees Clarke. &quot;You've got <i>her</i> fooled, all
right,&quot; she snarls at the fisheye, &quot;but <i>she's</i> a
goddamned basket case! She's not even sane! Your little tests don't
impress <i>me</i> one fucking bit!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
steps toward her. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
call me a basket case,&quot; she says, her voice absolutely level.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
what you <i>are</i>!&quot; Ballard shouts. &quot;You're sick! That's
why you're down here! They <i>need</i> you sick, they depend on it,
and you're so far gone you can't see it! You hide everything behind
that  that <i>mask</i> of yours, and you sit there like some
masochistic jellyfish and just take anything anyone dishes outyou
<i>ask</i> for it&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>That
used to be true</i>, Clarke realizes as her hands ball into fists.
<i>That's the strange thing.</i> Ballard begins to back away; Clarke
advances, step by step. <i>It wasn't until I came down here that I
learned that I could fight back</i>. <i>That I could win</i>. <i>The
rift taught me that, and now Ballard has too</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thank
you,&quot; Clarke whispers, and hits Ballard hard in the face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard
goes over backwards, collides with a table. Clarke calmly steps
forward. She catches a glimpse of herself in a glass icicle; her
capped eyes seem almost luminous.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh
Jesus,&quot; Ballard whimpers. &quot;Lenie, I'm <i>sorry</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stands over her. &quot;Don't be,&quot; she says. She sees herself as
some sort of exploding schematic, each piece neatly labeled. <i>So

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
her therapy ends before she can even get properly warmed up. A sudden
noise fills the lounge, shrill, periodic, vaguely familiar. It takes
a moment for Clarke to remember what it is. She lowers her foot.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Over
in the Communications cubby, the telephone is ringing.</font></font></p>

half an hour the 'scaphe has been dropping deeper into midnight. Now
the Comm monitor shows it settling like a great bloated tadpole onto
Beebe's docking assembly. Sounds of mechanical copulation reverberate
and die. The overhead hatch drops open. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ballard's
replacement climbs down, already mostly 'skinned, staring
impenetrably from eyes without pupils. His gloves are off; his 'skin
is open up to the forearms. Clarke sees the faint scars running along
his wrists, and smiles a bit inside.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Was

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Out
of sight down the corridor, a hatch hisses open. Ballard appears in
shirtsleeves, one eye swollen shut, carrying a single suitcase. She
seems about to say something, but stops when she sees the newcomer.
She looks at him for a moment. She nods briefly. She climbs into the
belly of the 'scaphe without a word.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nobody
calls down to them. There are no salutations, no morale-boosting
small talk. Perhaps the crew have been briefed. Perhaps they've
figured it out on their own. The docking hatch swings shut. With a
final clank, the 'scaphe disengages. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke

stands in front of her, his duffel bag at his feet. Slavic; dark
hair, pale skin, a face planed out by an underskilled woodworker. One
thick eyebrow shading both eyes. Not tall a hundred and eighty
centimeters, maybe but solid.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>You

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scars.
Not just on the wrists, on the face too. Very faint, a webwork echo
of old injuries. Too subtle for deliberate decoration, even if
Lubin's tastes run to that, but too obvious for reconstructive work;
medical technology learned how to erase such telltales decades ago.
Unless unless the injuries were <i>really</i> bad.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Is

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
reaches down, picks up his bag. His covered eyes betray nothing.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shakes her head. &quot;I'm second on the right. Take any of the
others.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
steps past her. Daggers of reflective glass protrude from the edges
of the far wall; within them, Lubin's fractured image disappears into
the corridor at Clarke's back. She moves across the lounge to that
jagged wall. <i>I should really clean this up one of these days... </i></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
used to like the way the mirror's worked since Ballard's adjustments.
The jigsaw reflections seem more creative, somehow. More
impressionistic. Now, though, they're beginning to wear on her. Maybe
it's time for another change.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
piece of Ken Lubin stares at her from the wall. Without thinking, she
drives her fist into the glass. A shower of fragments tinkles to the
floor.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
still enough mirror left to check; her face is free of any

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
does seem sorry, at that.</font></font></p>

You're not a beater.</i> Clarke leans against the bulkhead. <i>At
least, not my kind of beater.</i> She's not exactly sure how she
knows. There's some vital chemistry missing between them. Lubin, she
thinks, is a very dangerous man. Just not to her. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
smiles to herself. <i>Beating means never having to say you're sorry.</i></font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
tired enough of sharing the cubby with herself. Sharing it with
someone else is something she likes even less.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke lies on her bunk and scans the length of her own body. Past
her toes, another Lenie Clarke stares coolly back. The jumbled
topography of the forward bulkhead frames her reflected face like a
tabletop junkyard turned on edge.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
camera behind that mirror must see the same thing she does, but
distorted around the edges. Clarke figures on a wide-angle lens; the
GA wouldn't want to leave the corners out of range. What's the point
of running an experiment if you can't keep tabs on your subject
animals?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
wonders if anyone's watching her now. Probably not; at least, nobody
human. They'll have some machine, tireless and dispassionate,
something that watches with relentless attention as she works or
shits or gets herself off. It will be programmed to call flesh and
blood if she does anything interesting.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Interesting.</i>
Who defines that parameter? Is it strictly in keeping with the nature
of the experiment, or has someone programmed more personal tastes on
the side? Does anyone else get off when Lenie Clarke does?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
twists on the bed and faces the headboard bulkhead. A spaghetti
bundle of optical filaments erupts from the floor beside her pallet
and crawls up the middle of the wall, disappearing into the ceiling;
the seismic feeds, on their way to the communications cubby. The air
conditioning inlet sighs across her cheek, just to one side. Behind
it, a metal iris catches strips of light sectioned by the grating,
ready to sphincter shut the moment delta-p exceeds some critical
number of millibars per second. Beebe is a mansion with many rooms,
each potentially self-isolating in case of emergency. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
lies back on the bunk and lets her fingers drop to the deck. The
telemetry cartridge on the floor is almost dry now, fine runnels of
salt crusting its surface as the seawater evaporates. It's a basic
broad-spectrum model, studded with half a dozen senses: seismic,
temperature, flow, the usual sulfates and organics. Sensor heads
disfigure its housing like the spikes on a mace.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Which
is why it's here, now.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
closes her fingers around the carrying handle, lifts the cartridge
off the deck. Heavy. Neutrally buoyant in seawater, of course, but
9.5 kilos in atmosphere according to the specs. Mostly pressure
casing, very tough. An active smoker at five hundred atmospheres
wouldn't touch it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Maybe
it's a bit of overkill, sending it up against one lousy mirror.
Ballard started the job with her bare hands, after all.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Odd

cubby. One stubborn shard, half a meter long, hangs in its frame like
a loose tooth. She reaches out (mirror fragments tumble off her
thighs) and taps it with one hand. It crashes to the deck and
shatters. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
going to work out fine. It's been a few days now and he's been
scrupulous about keeping his distance. There's no sexual chemistry at
all, nothing to set them at each other's throats. Whatever Ken Lubin
did to Lana Cheung whatever those two did to each other
won't be an issue here. Lubin's tastes are too specific.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For
that matter, so are Clarke's.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
stands up, head bent to avoid the metal encrustations on the ceiling.
Glass crunches under her feet. The bulkhead behind the mirror,
freshly exposed, looks oily in the fluorescent light; a ribbed gray
face with only two distinguishing features. The first is a spherical
lens, smaller than a fingernail, tucked up in one corner. Clarke
pulls it from its socket, holds it between thumb and forefinger for a
second. A tiny glass eyeball. She drops it to the glittering deck. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
also a name, stamped into one of the alloy ribs: <i>Hansen
Fabrication</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
the first time she's seen see a brand name since she arrived here,
except for the GA logos pressed into the shoulders of their
diveskins. That seems odd, somehow. She checks the lightstrip running
the length of the ceiling; white and featureless. An emergency hydrox
tank next to the hatch: DOT test date, pressure specs, but no
manufacturer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't know if she should attach any significance to this.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Alone,
now. Hatch sealed, surveillance ended  even her own reflection
shattered beyond repair. For the first time, Lenie Clarke feels a
sense of real safety here in the station's belly. She doesn't quite
know what to do with it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Maybe
I could let my guard down a bit.</i> Her hands go to her face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At
first she thinks she's gone blind; the cubby seems so dark to her
uncapped eyes, walls and furniture receding into mere suggestions of
shadow. She remembers turning the lights down in increments in the
days since Ballard's departure, darkening this room, darkening every
other corner of Beebe Station. Lubin's been doing it too, although
they never talk about it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For
the first time she wonders at their actions. It doesn't make sense;
eyecaps compensate automatically for changes in ambient light, always
serve up the same optimum intensity to the retina. Why choose to live
in a darkness you don't even perceive?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
nudges the lights up a bit; the cubby brightens. Bright colors jar
the eye against a background of gray on gray. The hydrox tank
reflects fluorescent orange; readouts wink red and blue and green;
the handle on the bulkhead locker is a small exclamation of yellow.
She can't remember the last time she noticed color; eyecaps draw the
faintest images from darkness, but most of the spectrum gets lost in
the process. Only now, when the lights are up, can color reassert
itself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't like it. It seems raw and out of place down here. Clarke puts
her eyecaps back in, dims the lights to their usual minimal glow. The
bulkhead fades to a comforting wash of blue pastels.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Just

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Which,

The rag pile detached itself from the pylon and shuffled closer.
&quot;Vanceattle.&quot; The words came out half-whistled, as though
the kid was speaking through his sinuses. Maybe he had one of those,
those  Fischer groped for the words  cleft palates, or
something.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Vanceattle?
Which one?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Shrug.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
you have a watch?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lost

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">You've
got to help him, Shadow said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
um, look.&quot; Fischer rubbed at his temples. &quot;I live close by.
We can call from there.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
weren't that many Vanceattles in the lower mainland. The police
wouldn't have to find out. And even if they did, they wouldn't charge
him. Not for this. What was he supposed to do, leave the kid for body
parts?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
Gerry,&quot; Fischer said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Kevin.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
looked about nine or ten. Old enough that he should know how to use a
public terminal, anyway. But there was something wrong with him. He
was too tall and skinny, and his limbs tangled up in themselves when
he walked. Maybe he was brain damaged. Maybe one of those nanotech
babies that went bad. Or maybe his mother just spent too much time
outdoors when she was pregnant.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
led Kevin up to his two-room timeshare. Kevin dropped onto the couch
without asking. Fischer checked the fridge: root beer. The boy took
it with a nervous smile. Fischer sat down beside him and put a
reassuring hand on Kevin's lap. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
expression drained from Kevin's face as though someone had pulled a
plug.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Go
<i>on</i>, Shadow said. He's not complaining, is he?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin's
clothes were filthy. Caked mud clung to his pants. Fischer reached
over and began picking it off. &quot;We should get you out of these
clothes. Get you cleaned up. We can only take showers on even days
here, but you could always take a sponge bath...&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
just sat there. One hand gripped his drink, bony fingers denting the
plastic; the other rested motionless on the couch.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
smiled. &quot;It's okay. This is what you do when you really&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
stared at the floor, trembling.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
found a zipper, pulled. Pressed, gently. &quot;It's okay. It's okay.
Don't worry.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
stopped shaking. Kevin looked up. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
smiled.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not the one who should be worried here, asshole,&quot; he said in his
whistling child's voice.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
jolt threw Fischer to the floor. Suddenly he was staring at the
ceiling, fingers twitching at the ends of arms that had turned,
magically, into dead weights. His whole nervous system sang like a
tracery of high-tension wires embedded in flesh. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
bladder let go. Wet warmth spread out from his crotch.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
stepped over him and looked down, all trace of awkwardness gone from
his movements. One hand still held the plastic cup. The other held a
shockprod.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Very
deliberately, Kevin upended his drink. Fischer watched the liquid
snake down, almost casually, and splash across his face. His eyes
stung; Kevin was a spindly blur in a wash of weak acid. Fischer tried
to blink, tried again, finally succeeded.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
of Kevin's legs was swinging back at the knee.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gerald
Fischer, you are under arrest&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
swung forward. Pain erupted in Fischer's side.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;for
indecent assault of a minor&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Back.
Forward. Pain.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;under
sections 151 and 152 of the N'Am Pacific Criminal Code.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
child knelt down and glared into his face. Up close the telltales
were obvious; the depth of the eyes, the size of the pores in the
skin, the plastic resilience of adult flesh soaked in androgen
suppressants.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
to mention violation of yet <i>another</i> restraining order,&quot;
Kevin added.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>How
long,</i> Fischer wondered absently. Neural aftershock draped the
whole world in gauze. How many months did it take to stunt back down
from man to child? </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
have the right to ah, fuck.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
how long to reverse the reversal? Could Kevin ever grow up again?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know your fucking rights better than I do.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This
wasn't happening. The police wouldn't go this far, they didn't have
the money, and anyway, why? How could anyone be willing to <i>change
</i>themselves like that? Just to get Gerry Fischer? Why? </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
suppose I should call you in, shouldn't I? Then again, maybe I'll
just let you lie here in your own piss for a while...&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somehow,
he got the feeling that Kevin was hurting more than he was. It didn't
make sense.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
okay, Shadow told him softly. It's not your fault. They just don't
understand.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Kevin
was kicking him again, but Fischer could hardly feel it. He tried to
say something, anything, that would make his tormentor feel a little
better, but his motor nerves were still fried.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
could still cry, though. Different wiring.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was different this time. It started out the same, the scans and the
samples and the beatings, but then they took him out of the line and
cleaned him up, and put him in a side room. Two guards sat him down
at a table, across from a dumpy little man with brown moles all over
his face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hello,
Gerry,&quot; he said, pretending not to notice Fischer's injuries.
&quot;I'm Dr. Scanlon.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
a shrink.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
I'm more of a mechanic.&quot; He smiled, a prissy little smile that
said <i>I've just been very clever but you're probably too stupid to
get the joke.</i> Fischer decided he didn't like Scanlon much. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Still,
his type had been useful before, with all their talk about <i>competence</i>
and <i>criminal responsibility</i>. It's not so much what you did,
Fischer had learned, as why you did it. If you did things because you
were evil, you were in real trouble. If you did the same things
because you were sick, though, the doctors would sometimes cover for
you. Fischer had learned to be sick. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
pulled a headband out of his breast pocket. &quot;I'd like to talk to
you for a little while, Gerry. Would you mind putting this on for
me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
inside of the band was studded with sensor pads. It felt cool across
his forehead. Fischer looked around the room, but he couldn't see any
monitors or readouts.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Great.&quot;
Scanlon nodded to the guards. He waited until they'd left before he
spoke again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
a strange one, Gerry Fischer. We don't run into too many like you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
not what the other doctors said.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh?
What did they say?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
said I was typical. They said, they said lots of the one-fifty-one's
used the same <i>rationale</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
leaned forward. &quot;Well you know, that's true. It's a classic
line: 'I was teaching her about her awakening sexuality, doctor.'
'It's the parents' job to instruct their children, doctor.' 'They
don't like school either, but it's for their own good.'&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
never said those things. I don't even have kids.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No
you don't. But the point is, pedophiles often claim to be acting in
the best interests of the children. They turn sexual abuse into an
act of altruism, if you will.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
<i>not</i> abuse. It's what you do if you really love someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
leaned back in his chair and studied Fischer for a few moments.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
what's so interesting about you, Gerry.&quot;</font></font></p>

the end, they said they could take care of the charges. He knew there
had to be more to it than that, of course; they'd make him volunteer

to voluntary castration first. But the catch, when it came, wasn't
any of those things. He almost couldn't believe it.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;One

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
couldn't think of any reason why he would, but it didn't matter. If
he didn't take this deal they'd stick a governor in his head for the

about it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;One

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
patted his arm. &quot;Take your time, Gerry. Think about it. You

them but something must have stuck, because every morning he'd sit at
the console with his tutor  a real person, though, not a
program  and all the text and diagrams she showed him would be
strangely familiar. Like he'd known it all years ago, and had just
forgotten. Now he remembered everything: plate tectonics and
subduction zones, Archimedes Principle, the thermal conductivity of
two percent hydrox. Aldosterone. </font></font>

perfectly safe, Gerry.&quot; Scanlon smiled patiently, disentangling
himself. &quot;In fact, you wouldn't last very long down there
without it; human enzymes don't work well at high pressure. So we
loaded some extra genes into a tame virus and sent it in. It's been
rewriting you from the inside out. Judging by your fever I'd say it's
nearly finished. You should be feeling better in a day or so.&quot;</font></font></p>

frowned. &quot;What was that?&quot;</font></font></p>

Fischer concentrated. &quot;Mostly dehydrogenases, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
glanced at the machine by the bed. &quot;I'm, um, not sure.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
it. Dehydrogenases. But they tweaked them to reduce the activation
energy.&quot; He tapped his temple. &quot;It's all here. Only I
haven't done the tutorial yet.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's

day they put him in a tank built like a piston, five stories tall:
its roof could press down like a giant hand, squeezing whatever was
inside. They sealed the hatch and flooded the tank with seawater. </font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon had warned
him about the change. &quot;We flood your trachea and your head
cavities, but your lung and intestines aren't rigid so they just
squeeze down. We're immunizing you against pressure, you see? They
say it's a bit like drowning, but you get used to it.&quot; </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
wasn't that bad, actually. Fischer's guts twisted in on themselves,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
floated there in the tank, seawater sliding through the tubes in his
chest, and reflected on the queasy sensation of not breathing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
getting some turbulence.&quot; Scanlon's voice came at him from all
directions, as if the walls themselves were talking. &quot;From your
exhaust port.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
fine trail of bubbles was trickling from Fischer's chest. His eyecaps
made everything seem marvelously clear, like a hallucination. &quot;Just
a bit of&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
his voice. His words, but spoken by something else, some cheap
machine that didn't know about harmonics. One hand went automatically
to the disk embedded in his throat.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;hydrogen,&quot;
he tried again. &quot;No problem. Pressure'll squeeze them down when
I get deep enough.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.
Still.&quot; Other words, muffled, as Scanlon spoke to someone else.
Fischer felt something vibrate softly in his chest. The bubbles grew
larger, then smaller. Then disappeared.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
was back. &quot;Better?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.&quot;
Fischer didn't know how he felt about this, though. He didn't really
like having a chest full of machinery. He didn't really like having
to breathe by chopping water into chunks of hydrogen and oxygen. But
he <i>really</i> didn't like the idea of some tech he'd never even
met fiddling with his insides by remote control, reaching into his
body and messing around in there without even asking. It made him
feel</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Violated,
right?</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
a few moments he noticed a cold blue spark winking at him from
somewhere overhead. It seemed to cast a lot more light than it
should. As he watched, the inside of the tank reappeared in hazy
shades of blue-on-black.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Everything.
The inside of the tank. The hatch. Sort of bluish.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Right.
Luciferin light source.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
not very bright,&quot; Fischer said. &quot;Everything's sort of like,
dusk.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
it'd be pitch black without your eyecaps.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
suddenly, it was.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
lay there in utter darkness. Floaters wriggled at the corner of his

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
felt almost peaceful.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
do you mean, Gerry?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
wasn't, you know, qualified. Even after all this training I bet
there's lots of people who'd be better at this than me. Real
engineers.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
not so much what you know,&quot; Scanlon said. &quot;It's what you
are.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
knew what he was. People had been telling him for as long as he could
remember. He didn't see what the fuck that had to do with anything.
&quot;What's that, then?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At
first he thought he wasn't going to get an answer. But Scanlon
finally spoke, and when he did there was something in his voice that
Fischer had never heard before.</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The Pacific Ocean
slopped two kilometers under his feet. He had a cargo of blank-eyed
psychotics sitting behind him. And the lifter was being piloted by a
large pizza with extra cheese. Joel Kita liked it all about as much
as could be expected.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At
least he <i>had</i> been expecting it, this time. For once the GA
hadn't sprung one of their exercises in chaos theory onto his life
without warning. He'd seen it coming almost a week in advance, when
they'd sprung one onto Ray Stericker instead. Ray had been in this
very cockpit, watching the pizza being installed and no doubt
wondering when the term &quot;job security&quot; had become an
oxymoron.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
supposed to baby-sit it for a week,&quot; he had said then. Joel had
climbed up into the 'scaphe for the usual preflight check and found
his friend waiting by the controls. Ray had gestured up through the
open hatchway to the lifter's cockpit, where a couple of techs were
busy interfacing something to the controls. &quot;Just in case it
screws up in the field. Then I'm gone.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gone
where?&quot; Joel couldn't believe it. Ray had been on the Juan de
Fuca run forever, even before the geothermal program. Hed even
been an <i>employee</i>, back when such things were commonplace. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Probably
the Gorda circuit for a while. After that, who knows? They'll be
upgrading everything before long.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
glanced up through the hatch. The techs were playing with a square
vanilla box, half a meter on a side and about twice as thick as
Kita's wrist. &quot;What <i>is</i> the fucking thing? Some kind of
autopilot?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;With
a difference. This takes off and lands. And all sorts of lovely
things in between.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This
was not good news. Humans had always been able to integrate three-D
spatial information better than the machines that kept trying to
replace them. Not that machines couldn't recognize a tree or a
building when such objects were pointed out to them, but they got
real confused whenever you rotated any of those objects a few
degrees. The shapes changed, contrast and shadow shifted, and it
always took way too long for any of those arsenide pretenders to
update its spatial maps and recognize that yes, it's still a tree,
and no, it didn't morph into something else, dummy, you just changed
your point of view.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
some places that wasn't a problem. Ocean surfaces, for example. Or
controlled-access highways where the cars had their own ID
transponders. Or even lashed to the underside of a giant squashed
doughnut filled with buoyant vacuum, floating in mid-air. These had
been respected and venerable environments for autopilots since well
before the turn of the century.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Take-offs
and landings were a different scene altogether, though. Too many real
objects going by too fast, too many things to keep an eye on. A few
billion years of natural selection still had the edge when the fast
lane got that crowded.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Until
now, apparently.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Let's
get out of here.&quot; Ray dropped down onto the landing pad. Joel
followed him out to the edge of the roof. Green tangled blankets of
kudzu<sub>4</sub> spread out around them, shrouding the roofs of
surrounding buildings. It always made Joel think post-apocalypse 
weeds and ivy crawling back in from the wilderness to strangle the
residue of some fallen civilization. Except, of course, these
particular weeds were supposed to <i>save</i> civilization.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Way
out by the coast, barely visible, streamers of smoke dribbled into
the sky from the refugee strip. <i>So much for civilization.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
one of those smart gels,&quot; Ray said at last.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Smart
gels?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Head
cheese. Cultured brain cells on a slab. The same things they've been
plugging into the Net to firewall infections.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know what they are, Ray. I just can't fucking believe it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
believe it. They'll be coming for you too, give 'em enough time.&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.
Probably.&quot; Joel let it sink in. &quot;I wonder when.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ray
shrugged. &quot;You've got some breathing space. All that
unpredictable volcanic shit, things blowing up under you. Nastier
than flying a hoover. Harder to replace you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
looked back at the lifter, and the 'scaphe nestled into its
underbelly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Won't
take long, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
fished a derm out of his pocket; a tricyclic with a mild lithium
chaser. He held it out without a word.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ray
just spat. &quot;Thanks anyway. I <i>want</i> to feel pissed for a
while, you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">* * *</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
now, eight days later, Ray Stericker was gone.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He'd
disappeared after his last shift, just the day before. Joel had tried
to track him down, drag him out, piss him up, but he hadn't been able
to find the man on site and Ray wasn't answering his watch. So here
was Joel Kita, back on the job, alone except for his cargo; four very
strange people in black suits, blank white lenses covering their
eyes. They all had identical GA logos stamped onto their shoulders,
tags with their surnames printed just below. At least the surnames
were different, although the difference seemed trivial; male, female,
large or small, they all seemed minor variants of the same make and
model. <i>Ah yes, the Mk-5 was always such a nice boy. Kind of quiet,
kept to himself. Who would've thought...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
had seen rifters before. He'd ferried a couple out to Beebe about a
month ago, just after construction had ended. One of them had seemed
almost normal, had gone out of her way to chat and joke around as if
trying to compensate for the fact that she looked like a zombie. Joel
had forgotten her name.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
other one hadn't said a word.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
of the 'scaphe's tactical screens beeped a progress report. &quot;Bottom's
rising again,&quot; Joel called back. &quot;Thirty five hundred.
We're almost there.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thanks,&quot;
one of them  <i>Fischer</i>, according to his shoulder tag 
said. Everyone else just sat there.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
pressure hatch separated the 'scaphe's cockpit from the passenger
compartment. If you sealed it you could use the aft chamber as an
airlock, or even pressurize it for saturation dives if you didn't
mind the hassle of decompression. You could also just swing the hatch
shut if you wanted a bit of privacy, if you didn't like leaving your
back exposed to certain passengers. That would be bad manners, of
course. Joel tried idly to think of some socially acceptable excuse
for slamming that big metal disk in their faces, but gave up after a
few moments. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now,
the dorsal hatch  the one leading up into the lifter's cockpit
 that one <i>was</i> closed, and that felt wrong. Usually they
kept it open until just before the drop. Ray and Joel would shoot the
shit for however long the trip would take  three hours, if you
were going to Channer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Yesterday,
without warning, Ray Stericker had dropped the hatch shut fifteen
minutes into the flight. He hadn't said an unnecessary word the whole
time, had barely even used the intercom. And today  well,
today there wasn't anyone up there to talk to any more.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
looked out one of the side ports. The skin of the lifter blocked his
view just a few centimeters on the other side; metal fabric stretched
across carbon-fiber ribs, a gray expanse sucked into concave squares
by the hard vacuum inside. The 'scaphe rode tucked into an oval
hollow in the lifter's center. The only port that showed anything but
gray skin was the one between Joel's feet; ocean, a long way down.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
so far down now, though. He could hear the hisses and sighs of the
lifter's ballast bags deflating overhead. Sharper sounds, more
distant, cracked through the hull as electrical arcs heated the air
in a couple of trim bags. This was still regular autopilot territory,
but Ray used to do it all himself anyway. If it weren't for the
closed hatch, Joel couldn't have told the difference.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
head cheese was doing a bang-up job.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He'd
actually seen it a few days ago, during a delivery to an undersea rig
just out of Gray's Harbor. Ray had hit a stud and the top of the box
had slid away like white mercury, slipping back into a little groove
at the edge of the casing and revealing a transparent panel

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Beneath
that panel, packed in clear fluid, was a ridged layer of goo, a bit
too gray to be mozzarella. Dashes of brownish glass perforated the
goo in neat parallel rows.</font></font></p>

what are those little brown bits?&quot;</font></font></p>

something like this.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ray

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
sudden, smooth shift in momentum. Joel pulled back to the present;
the lifter was hanging stable, five meters over the waves. Right on
target. Nothing but empty ocean on the surface, of course; Beebe's
transponder was thirty meters straight down. Shallow enough to home
in on, too deep to be a navigational hazard. Or to serve as a
midwater hitching post for charter boats hunting Channer's legendary
sea monsters.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel's
finger wavered over the OK key, then came down. Docking latches
clanked open; the lifter reeled Joel Kita and his cargo down to the
water. Sunlight squinted through viewports for a few seconds as the
'scaphe swung in its harness. A wavetop batted at the forward port.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The

opened the ballast tanks and looked back over his shoulder. &quot;Going

Scanlon meant by that.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
doesn't <i>feel</i> pre-adapted, not if that means he's supposed to
be at home here. Nobody even talked to him on the way down. Nobody
talked much to anyone else, either, but when they didn't talk to
Fisher it seemed especially personal. And one of them, Brander
it's hard to tell with the eyecaps and all, but Fischer thinks
Brander keeps looking at him, like they know each other from
somewhere. Brander looks mean.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Everything's
out in the open down here; pipes and cable bundles and ventilation
ducts are all tacked onto the bulkheads in plain sight. He saw it on
the vids before he came down, but those somehow left the impression
of a brighter place, full of light and mirrors. The wall he's facing
now, for instance; there should be a mirror there. But it's just a
gray metal bulkhead with a greasy, unfinished sheen to it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
shifts his weight from one foot to the other. At one end of the
lounge Lubin leans against a library pedestal, his capped eyes
pointed at them with blank disinterest. Lubin's said only one thing
to them in the five minutes they've been here:</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Clarke's
still outside. She's coming in.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
clanks under the floor. Water and nitrox mix, gurgling, nearby. The
sound of a hatch swinging open, movement from below.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
climbs up into the lounge, droplets beading across her shoulders. Her
diveskin paints her black below the neck, a skinny silhouette, almost
sexless. Her hood is undone; blond hair, plastered against her skull,
frames a face paler than Fischer's ever seen. Her mouth is a wide
thin line. Her eyes, capped like his own, are blank white ovals in a
child's face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks around at them: Brander, Nakata, Caraco, Fischer. They look
back, waiting. There's something in Nakata's face, Fischer thinks,
something like recognition, but Lenie Clarke doesn't seem to notice.
She doesn't seem to notice any of them, really.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shrugs. &quot;I'm changing the sodium on number two. A couple of you
could come along, I guess.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't seem exactly human. There <i>is</i> something familiar about
her, though.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a street where none of the buildings have windows. The streetlamps
shine down with a sick coppery light on masses of giant clams and big
ropy brownish things emerging from mucous-gray cylinders (tube worms,
he remembers: <i>Riftia fuckinghugeous</i>, or something). Natural
chimneys rise here and there above the invertebrate multitudes,
pillars of basalt and silicon and crystallized sulfur. Every time
Fischer visits the Throat, he thinks of really bad acne.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke leads them on a flight down Main Street: Fischer, Caraco, a
couple of cargo squids on remote. The generators lean up over them on
both sides. A dark curtain billows across the road directly ahead,
and it <i>sparkles</i>. A school of small fish darts around the edges
of the streaming cloud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
the problem,&quot; Lenie buzzes. She looks back at Fischer and
Caraco. &quot;Mud plume. Too big to redirect.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They've
come past eight generators so far. That leaves six up ahead, drowning
in silt. Double shift, even if they call out Lubin and Brander.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
hopes they don't have to. Not Brander, anyway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
fins off towards the plume. The squids whine softly behind, dragging
their tools. Fischer steels himself to follow.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Shouldn't
we check thermal?&quot; Caraco calls out. &quot;I mean, what if it's
hot?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
was wondering that himself, actually. He's been wondering about such
things ever since he overheard Caraco and Nakata comparing rumors
from the Mendocino fracture. Nakata heard it was a really old
minisub, with Plexiglas ports. Caraco heard they were thermoacrylate.
Nakata said it got wedged inside the center of the rift zone. Caraco
said no, it was just cruising over the seabed and a smoker blew up
under it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
agreed on how fast the viewports melted, though. Even the skeletons
went to ash. Which didn't make much difference anyway, since every
bone in every body had already been smashed by the ambient pressure.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
makes a lot of sense, in Fischer's opinion, but Lenie Clarke doesn't
even answer. She just fins off into that black sparkly cloud and
disappears. At the spot she disappears the mud glows suddenly, a
phosphorescent wake. The fish swarm towards it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She
doesn't even care, sometimes,&quot; Fischer buzzes softly. &quot;Like,
whether she lives or dies...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
looks at him for a moment, then kicks off towards the plume.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
dives into the roiling wall with a splash of light. A knot of fish
a couple of them are a fair size now, Fischer sees swirl in
her wake.</font></font></p>

moves.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
spins around. For a moment there's only Main Street, fading in
distance.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Then
something big and black and...and <i>lopsided</i> appears from behind
one of the generators.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Jeez.</i>&quot;
Fischer's legs move of their own volition. &quot;They're coming!&quot;
he tries to yell. The vocoder scales it down to a croak.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Stupid.
Stupid.</i> <i>They warned us, the sparkles bring in the little fish

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
plume is right in front of him now, a wall of sediment, a river on
the bottom of the ocean. He dives in. Something nips lightly at his
calf.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Everything
goes black, with occasional sparkles. He turns his headlight on; the
flowing mud swallows the beam half a meter from his face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
Clarke can see it, somehow: &quot;Turn it off.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good.
Maybe they won't either.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
kills the light. In the darkness he gropes the gas billy from its
sheath on his leg.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco,
from a distance: &quot;I thought they were blind...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Some
of them.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
they've got other senses to fall back on. Fischer runs through the
list: <i>smell, sound, pressure waves, bioelectric fields</i>...
Nothing <i>relies</i> on vision down here. It's just one of the
options. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
hopes the plume blocks more than just light.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
even as he watches, the darkness is lifting. Black murk turns brown,
then almost gray. Faint light filters in from the floodlamps on Main
Street.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>It's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
still can't see very far, though. It's like being caught in dirty
fog.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Remember.&quot;
Clarke, very close. &quot;They're not as tough as they look. They
probably won't do much real damage.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
sonar pistol stutters nearby. &quot;I'm not getting anything,&quot;
Caraco buzzes. Milky sediment swirls on all sides. Fischer puts his
arm out; it fades at the elbow.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Lenie</i>&quot;
Fischer cries.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
bump from behind. A slap on the back of his head. A shadow, black and
spiny, fades into the murk.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Hey,
that wasn't so</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
clamps onto his leg. He looks down: jaws, teeth, a monstrous head
fading away into the murk.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Oh
Jeez</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
jams his billy against scaly flesh. Something gives, like gelatin. A
soft thump. The flesh bloats, ruptures; bubbles explode from the rip.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
else smashes him from behind. His chest is in a vise. He lashes out,
blindly. Mud and ash and black blood billow into his face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
grabs blindly, twists. There's a broken tooth in his hand, half as
long as his forearm; he tightens his grip and it splinters. He drops
it, brings the billy around and jams it into the thing on his side.
Another explosion of meat and compressed CO<sub>2</sub><i>.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
pressure lifts from his chest. Whatever's clamped onto his leg isn't
moving. Fischer lets himself sink, drifts down against the base of a
barite chimney.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nothing

&quot;You're lucky they told you that much.&quot; She pulls her

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks down. His diveskin's only a couple of millimeters thick, it
doesn't hide anything. He feels his erection going soft under her
gaze.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie's
cold white eyes track back to his face. Fischer feels his face
heating before he remembers: she can't see his eyes. No one can.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
almost safe in here.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bruising's
the biggest problem,&quot; Lenie says at last. &quot;They don't
puncture the diveskin all that often, but the force of the bite still
gets through.&quot; Her hand is on his arm, firm and professional,
probing the edges of Fischer's injury. It hurts, but he doesn't mind.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
uncaps a tube of anabolic salve. &quot;Here. Rub this in.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
pain fades on contact. His flesh goes warm and tingly where he
applies the ointment. He reaches out, a little bit scared, and
touches Lenie's arm. &quot;Thanks.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
twists out of reach without a word, bending down to seal the 'skin on
her leg. Fischer watches the leggings slide up her body. They seem
almost alive. They <i>are</i> almost alive, he remembers. The 'skin's
got these <i>reflexes</i>, changes its permeability and thermal
conductivity in response to body temperature. Maintains, what's the
word, homeostasis.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now
he watches it swallowing Lenie's body like some slick black amoebae
but she's showing through underneath, black ice instead of white but
still the most beautiful creature he's ever seen. She's so far away.
There's someone inside telling him to watch it</font></font></p>

he can't help himself, he can almost <i>touch</i> her, she's bent

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
she straightens, bumping into his hand. Her face comes up; something
burns behind her eyecaps. He pulls back but it's too late; her whole

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
a few places, the rift is almost gentle.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Usually
the heat stabs up in boiling muddy pillars or jagged bolts of
superheated liquid. Steam never gets a chance to form at three
hundred atmospheres, but thermal distortion turns the water into a
column of writhing liquid prisms, hotter than molten glass. Not here,
though. In this one spot, nestled between lava pillows and safe from
Beebe's prying ears, the heat wafts up through the mud like a soft
breeze. The underlying bedrock must be porous.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
comes here when she can, keeping to the bottom en route to foil
Beebe's sonar. The others don't know about this place yet; she'd just
as soon keep it that way. Sometimes she comes here to watch
convection stir the mud into lazy curlicues. Sometimes she splits the
seals on her 'skin, basks face and arms in the thirty-degree seep.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sometimes
she just comes here to sleep.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
lies with the shifting mud at her back, staring up into blackness.
This is how you fall asleep when you can't close your eyes; you stare
into the dark, and when you start seeing things you know you're
dreaming.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now
she sees herself, the high priestess of a new troglodyte society. She
was the first one here, deep at peace while the others were still
being cut open and reshaped by grubby Dryback hands. She's the
founding mother, the template against which other, rawer recruits
trace themselves. They come down and they see that her eyes are
always capped, and they go and do likewise. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she knows it isn't true. The rift is the real creative force here, a
blunt hydraulic press forcing them all into shapes of its own
choosing. If the others are anything like her it's because they're
all being squeezed in the same mold.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>And
let's not forget the GA. If Ballard was right, they made sure we

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
are all the superficial differences, of course. A bit of racial
diversity. Token beaters, token victims, males and females equally
represented...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
has to smile at that. Count on Management to jam a bunch of sexual
dysfunctionals together and then make sure the gender ratio is

twists back in the opposite direction. A bit better. She trips her
headlamp, kicking as hard as she can. The world turns from black to
solid brown. Zero viz. Mud seething on all sides. Somewhere close by
she hears rocks splitting open.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
headlamp catches the outcropping looming up a split second before she
hits it. The shock rocks her skull, runs down her spine like a small
earthquake. There's a different flavor of pain up there now, mingling
with the searing in her eyes. She gropes blindly around the obstacle,
keeps going. Her body feels <i>warm</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
takes a lot of heat to get through a diveskin, especially a class

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Black.
The world is black again, and clear. Clarke's headlamp stabs out
across open space, lays a jiggling footprint on the mud a good ten
meters away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
view's still rippling, though.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
pain seems to be fading. She can't be sure. So many nerves have been
screaming for so long that even the echoes are torture. She clutches
her head, still kicking; the movement twists her around to face the
way she came.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
secret hideaway has exploded into a wall of mud and sulfur compounds,
boiling up from the seabed. Clarke checks her thermister; 45°C,
and she's a good ten meters away. Boiled fish skeletons spin in the
thermals. Geysers hiss further in, unseen. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
seep must have burst through the crust in an instant; any flesh

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
mirror.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
stares at it, confused. A silver glass shard with a dark bloody tip,
like a small tooth. There's no mirror in his cubby.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
reaches up and touches the bulkhead behind his pillow. Lenie's there,
Lenie's just the other side. But here, on <i>this</i> side there's a
dark line, a rim of shadow he never noticed before. His eyes follow
it around the edge of the wall, a gap about half a centimeter wide.
Here and there little bits of glass are still wedged into that space.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
used to be a mirror covering this whole bulkhead. Just like Scanlon's
vids. And it wasn't just removed, judging from the little fragments
left behind. Somebody smashed it out.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie.
She went through the whole station, before the rest of them came
down, and she smashed all the mirrors. He doesn't know why he's so
sure, but somehow it seems like exactly the sort of thing Lenie
Clarke would do when no one was looking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Maybe
she doesn't like to see herself. Maybe she's ashamed.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Go
talk to her, Shadow says.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Yes
you can. I'll help you.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
picks up the tunic of his 'skin. It slithers around his body, its
edges fusing together along the midline of his chest. He steps over
the sleeves and leggings still spilled across the deck, reaches down
for his eyecaps.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Leave
them there.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Leave

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
leans against the closed hatch, eyes shut, his breathing loud and
rapid in his ears.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
corridor outside is in deep twilight. Fischer moves along it to
Lenie's sealed hatch. He touches it, afraid to knock.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From
behind, someone taps his shoulder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She's
out,&quot; Brander says. His 'skin is done right up to his neck, arms
and legs completely sealed. His capped eyes are blank and hard. And
there's the usual edge in his voice, that same familiar tone saying
<i>Just give me an excuse, asshole, just do anything...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Maybe
he wants Lenie too.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Don't

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
reaches out, pokes Fischer's face. His finger comes away sticky.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
tries to edge past Brander to his own cubby. The corridor pushes them
together.</font></font></p>

say Lubin sleeps out here. Lenie too, sometimes, but Lubin hasn't
slept in his bunk since the rest of them came down. He keeps his
headlight off, and he stays away from the lit part of the Throat, and
nothing bothers him. Fischer heard Nakata and Caraco talking about it
on the last shift.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
starting to sound like a good idea. The less time he spends in Beebe

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
station is a dim faraway blotch, glowing to Fischer's left. Brander's
in there. He goes on duty in three hours. Fischer figures he can just
stay out here until then. He doesn't really need to go inside much.
None of them do. There's a little desalinator piggybacked on his
electrolyser in case he gets thirsty, and a bunch of flaps and valves
that do things he doesn't want to think about, when he has to piss or
take a dump.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
getting a bit hungry, but he can wait. He's fine out here as long as

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
others keep out of it, for the most part. Nakata, the nervous one,
just keeps out of everyone's way. Caraco acts like she couldn't care
less if he boiled alive in a smoker. Lubin just sits there, looking
at the floor and smoldering; even Brander leaves him alone. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
Lenie. Lenie's cold and distant as a mountaintop. No, Fischer's not
getting any help with Brander. So when it comes to a choice between
the monsters out here or the one in there, it's an easy call.</font></font></p>

clanks in the locker, still ignoring them all. The airlock begins
cycling.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
'lock swings open. Lenie Clarke steps out, fins in one hand. Her
blank eyes sweep across the room; they don't pause at Fischer. She
carries her fins to the drying rack without a word.</font></font></p>

punches Fischer in the stomach. Fischer doubles over, gasping; his
head smashes into the airlock hatch. He can't catch his breath. The
deck scrapes his cheek. Brander's boot is almost touching his nose.</font></font></p>

lashes out almost too fast to see. Fischer reels, catches himself on

that isn't</font></font></p>

closes the hatch. There's enough room for two in there  the

seabed is glowing. Cracks in the rock flicker comforting shades of
orange, like hot coals, and he knows that's thermal; the scalding
rivulets feel warm even through his 'skin, his thermister leaps
around every time the current twitches. But there are places here
where the rocks shine green, and others where they shine blue. He
doesn't know whether to thank biology or geochemistry. All he knows
is that it's beautiful. It's a city from high up, at night. It's a
vid of the northern lights he saw once, only sharper and brighter.
It's a brush fire in emeralds.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
a way he's almost grateful to Brander. If it weren't for Brander he'd
never have come upon this place. He'd be sitting in Beebe with the
rest of them, hooked into the library or hiding in his cubby, safe
and dry.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
Beebe's no refuge with Brander inside. Beebe's a gauntlet. So today
Fischer just stayed away when his shift ended, crawled off across the
ocean floor, exploring. Now, somewhere far from the Throat, he
discovers <i>real</i> sanctuary.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
rattail cruises into view about half a meter up, its underside a
jigsaw of reflected color. It thrashes once, suddenly; violent
shivers run the length of its body. The water around it shimmers with
heat distortion. The fish spins lopsidedly, tail-down, in the wake of
the little eruption. Its body turns white in seconds, begins to fray
at the edges.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Four
hundred eight degrees Centigrade: that's maximum recorded temperature
for hot seeps on the Juan de Fuca rift. Fischer thinks back for the
temperature rating on diveskin copolymer.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
sculls up into the water column a bit, just in case. As soon as he
clears bottom clutter he feels the faint, regular tapping of Beebe's
sonar against his insides.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That's
odd. This far out, he shouldn't be able to feel the signal, not
unless they'd really cranked it up. And they wouldn't do <i>that</i>
unless</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
checks the time.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">By
the time he makes it back to the Throat they're halfway through
stripping number four. They open a space on the line for him. Lenie
doesn't want to hear his apologies. She doesn't want to talk to him
at all. That hurts, but Fischer can't really blame her. Maybe he can
make it up to her soon. Maybe he can take her sightseeing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's

relents. Lenie's fingers push between lids that feel as puffy as

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
this praying mantis a meter long, all black with chrome trim, hanging
upside-down from the ceiling of the medical cubby. It's been sleeping
up there ever since Fischer first arrived. Now it hovers over his
face, jointed arms clicking and dipping like crazy articulated
chopsticks. Every now and then one of its feelers winks red light,
and Fischer can smell the scent of his own flesh cauterizing. It kind
of bothers him. What's even worse is, he can't move his head. The
neuroinduction field in the Med table has got him paralyzed from the
neck up. He keeps wondering what would happen if the focus slipped,
if that damping energy ended up pointing at his lungs. At his <i>heart</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
mantis stops in midmotion, its antennae quivering. It keeps
completely still for a few seconds. &quot;Hello, er Gerry,
isn't it?&quot; it says at last. &quot;I'm Dr. Troyka.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
sounds like a woman.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
are we doing here?&quot; Fischer tries to answer, but his head and
neck are still just so much dead meat. &quot;No, don't try to
answer,&quot; the mantis says, &quot;Rhetorical question. I'm
checking your readouts now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
remembers: the medical equipment can't always do everything on its
own. Sometimes, when things get too complicated, it calls up the line
to a human backup.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Wow,&quot;
says the mantis. &quot;What happened to you? No, don't answer that
either. I don't want to know.&quot; An accessory arm springs into
sight and passes back and forth across Fischer's line of sight. &quot;I'm
going to override the damping field for a moment. It might hurt a
bit. Try not to move when that happens, except to answer my
questions.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Pain
floods across Fischer's face. It's not too bad. Familiar, even. His
eyelids feel scratchy, and his tongue is dry. He tries blinking; it
works. He closes his mouth, rubs his tongue against swollen cheeks.
Better.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't suppose you want to come back up?&quot; Dr. Troyka asks,
hundreds of kilometers away. &quot;You know these injuries are bad
enough to warrant a recall.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
shakes his head. &quot;That's okay. I can stay here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot; The mantis doesn't sound surprised. &quot;I've been
hearing that a fair bit lately. Okay, I'm going to wire your
cheekbone back together, and I'll be planting a little battery under
your skin. Just below the right eye. It'll basically kick your bone
cells into overdrive, speed up the healing process. It's just a
couple of millimeters across, you'll feel like you've got sort of a
hard pimple. It may itch, but try not to pick at it. When you're
healed up you can just squeeze it out like a zit. Okay?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;All
right, Gerry. I'm going to turn the field back on and get to work.&quot;
The mantis whirrs in anticipation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer
holds up a hand. &quot;Wait.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
is it, Gerry?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What...what
time is it, up there?&quot; he asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
oh five ten. Pacific daylight. Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
early.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sure
is.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
guess I got you up,&quot; Fischer says. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nonsense.&quot;
Digits on the end of mechanical arms wiggle absently. &quot;I've been
up for hours. Graveyard shift.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Graveyard?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're
on duty around the clock, Gerry. There's a lot of geothermal stations
out there, you know. You you keep us pretty busy, as a rule.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh,&quot;
Fischer says. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Forget
it. It's my job.&quot; There's a humming, somewhere in the back of
his head; for a moment Fischer can feel the muscles of his face going
slack. Then everything goes numb, and the mantis swoops down him like
a predator.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
knows better than to open up outside.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
doesn't kill you, not right away. But seawater's a lot saltier than
blood; let it inside and osmosis sucks the water from the epithelial
cells, shrivels them down to viscous little blobs. Rifter kidneys are
modified to speed up water reclamation when that happens, but it's
not a long-term solution and it costs. Organs wears out faster, urine
turns to oil. It's best to just keep sealed up. Your insides soak in
seawater too long, they sort of <i>corrode</i>, implants or no
implants.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
that's another one of Fischer's problems. He never takes the long
view.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
face seal is a single macromolecule fifty centimeters long. It wraps
back and forth along the line of the jaw like the two sides of a
zipper, with hydrophobic side-chains for teeth. A little blade on the
index of Fischer's left glove can split them apart. He runs it along
the seal and the 'skin opens neatly around his mouth.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
doesn't feel much of anything at first. He was half-expecting the
ocean to charge up his nose and burn his sinuses, but of course all
his body cavities are already packed with isotonic saline. The only
immediate change is that his face gets cold, numbing the chronic ache
of torn flesh a bit. Deeper pain pulses under one eye, where Dr.
Troyka's wires hold the bones of his face together; microelectricity
tingles along those lines, press-gangs bonebuilding osteoblasts into
high gear. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
a couple of moments he tries to gargle; that doesn't work, so he
settles for gaping like a fish and wriggling his tongue around. That
does it. He gets his first taste of raw ocean, coarse and saltier
than the stuff that pumps him up inside.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">On
the seabed in front of him, a swarm of blind shrimp feeds in the
current from a nearby vent. Fischer can see right through them.
They're like little chunks of glass with blobs of organs jiggling
around inside.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
must be fourteen hours since he's eaten, but there's no fucking way
he's going back to Beebe with Brander still inside. The last time he
tried, Brander was actually standing guard in the lounge, waiting for
him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>What
the hell. It's just like krill. People eat this stuff all the time.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
have a strange taste. Fischer's mouth is going numb from the cold,
but there's still a faint sense of rotten eggs, dilute and barely
detectable. Not bad other than that, though. Better than Brander by a
long shot.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When

squints at her through a haze of nausea. Lenie Clarke is actually
making small talk. She's <i>never</i> done that before. He's still
trying to figure out why when his stomach clamps down again and he
pitches onto the floor. By now nothing comes up but a few dribbles of
sour fluid.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
eyes trace the pipes tangling along the ceiling. After a while

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Anyway.&quot;
Lenie shrugs the mood away. &quot;You're crazy to eat anything that
near a rift zone. Didn't you learn about hydrogen sulfide?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
nods. &quot;Basic training. The vents spit it out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
it builds up in the benthos. They're toxic. Which I guess you know

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She

he looks. He knows this place. He's on the bottom of the Pacific
Ocean. He's back in fairyland. He thinks he comes here a lot now,
watches the lights and bubbles, listens to the deep rocks grinding
against each other.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Maybe
he'll stay this time, watch the whole thing working, but then he

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's

can't be right. His caps should take care of all that. Maybe they're

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks. Four's fifteen meters away and the water's a bit murky this
shift. Still, she can see something big and dark sticking to the
intake vent. Its shadow twitches down along the casing like an
absurdly stretched black spider.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
fins forward a few meters, Caraco at her side. The two women exchange
looks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Fischer,
hanging upside down against the mesh. It's been four days since
anyone's seen him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
gently sets down her carry bag; Caraco follows her lead. Two or three
kicks bring them to within five meters of the intake. Machinery hums
omnipresently, makes a sound deep enough to feel.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
facing away from them, drifting from side to side, tugged by the
gentle suction of the intake vent. The vent's grillwork is fuzzy with
rooted growing things; small clams, tube worms, shadow crabs. Fischer
pulls squirming clumps from the intake, leaves them to drift or to
fall to the street below. He's cleaned maybe two meters square so
far.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
nice to see he still takes some duties seriously.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey.
Fischer,&quot; Caraco says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
spins around as if shot. His forearm flails toward Clarke's face; she
raises her own just in time. In the next instant he's bowled past
her. She kicks, steadies herself. Fischer's heading for the darkness
without looking back.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fischer,&quot;
Clarke calls out. &quot;Stop. It's okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
stops kicking for a moment, looks back over his shoulder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
me,&quot; she buzzes. &quot;And Judy. We won't hurt you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Barely
visible now, he rotates to a stop and turns to face them. Clarke
risks a wave.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Come
on, Fischer. Give us a hand.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
comes up behind her. &quot;Lenie, what are you doing?&quot; She's
turned her vocoder down to a hiss. &quot;He's too far gone, he's&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
cranks her own vocoder down. &quot;Shut up, Judy.&quot; Up again.
&quot;What do you say, Fischer? Earn your pay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
coming back into the light, hesitantly, like a wild animal lured by
the promise of food. Closer, Clarke can see the line of his jaw
moving up and down under his hood. The motions are jerky, erratic, as
though he's learning them for the first time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Finally
a noise comes out. &quot;Oh kay&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
goes back and retrieves their gear. Clarke offers a scraper to
Fischer. After a moment, he takes it, clumsily, and follows them to
number four.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
<i>can</i>, maybe. If it works out, they said. But we have to like
each other or they could send me back</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
crying now, she's rubbing against him so hard the bed shakes, &quot;<i>Please
can't you like me please I'll do anything I'll even</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
he never finds out what she'll even do because that's when the door
slams open and whatever happens after that, Gerry Fischer can't
remember.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Shadow,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she's back with him now, in the cold and the dark where it's safe.
Somehow. Beebe's a dim gray glow in the distance. She floats against
that backdrop like a black cardboard cutout. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Shadow...&quot;
Not his voice.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;
Not hers. &quot;Lenie.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Twin
crescents, thin as fingernails, reflect from her eyes. Even in two
dimensions she's beautiful.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Mangled
words buzz from her throat: &quot;You know who I am? You can
understand me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
nods, then wonders if she can see it. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't lately you're sort of gone, Fischer. Like you've
forgotten how to be human.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
tries to laugh, but the vocoder can't handle it. &quot;It comes and
goes, I think. I'm...lucid now, anyway. That's the word, isn't it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
shouldn't have come back inside.&quot; Machinery strips any feeling
from her words. &quot;He says he'll kill you. Maybe you should just
stay out of his way.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,&quot;
he says, and thinks it actually might be.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
can bring food out, I guess. They don't care about that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
okay. I can  go fishing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'll
call for a 'scaphe. It can pick you up out here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
I can swim back up myself if I want to. Not far.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
I'll tell them to send someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'll

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
sure?&quot; Lenie says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.&quot;
His arm hurts. He doesn't know why.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
turns slightly. The dim reflections vanish from her eyes for a long
moment.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie's

get going.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't leave. She doesn't say anything for almost a minute.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Then:
&quot;Who's Shadow?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">More
silence. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She's
a...friend. When I was young.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She
means a lot to you.&quot; Not a question. &quot;Do you want me to
send her a message?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She's
dead,&quot; Fischer says, marveling that he's really known it all
along.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Didn't
mean to,&quot; he says. &quot;But she had her own mom and dad, you
know, why did she need <i>mine</i>? She went back where she belonged.
That's all.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Where
she belonged,&quot; Lenie buzzes, almost too softly to hear.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
my fault,&quot; he says. It's hard to talk. It didn't used to be this
hard.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Someone's
touching him. Lenie. Her hand is on his arm, and he knows it's
impossible but he can feel the warmth of her body through his 'skin.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gerry.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
wasn't she with her own family?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She
<i>said</i> they hurt her. She always said that. That's how she got
in. She <i>used</i> it, it always worked...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
<i>always</i>, Shadow reminds him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
then she went back,&quot; Lenie murmurs.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
didn't mean to.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
sound comes out of Lenie's vocoder, and he has no idea what it is.
&quot;Brander's right, isn't he. About you and kids.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somehow,
he knows she's not accusing him. She's just checking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
what you do,&quot; he tells her. &quot;When you really love
someone.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh,
Gerry. You're so completely fucked up.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
string of clicks taps faintly on the machinery in his chest.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
looking for me,&quot; she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Be
careful, okay?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
could stay. Here.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
silence answers him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
I'll come out and visit sometimes,&quot; she buzzes at last. She
rises up into the water, turns away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bye,&quot;
Shadow says. It's the first time she's spoken aloud since she came
inside, but Fischer doesn't think Lenie notices the difference.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
then she's gone, for now.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she comes out here all the time. Alone, sometimes. He knows it isn't
over. And when she goes back and forth with the others, doing all the
things <i>he</i> used to do, he'll be there, off where no one can
see. Checking up. Making sure she's okay.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Like
her own guardian angel. Right, Shadow?</i></font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A week later
Fischer's replacement comes down on the 'scaphe. Nobody stands watch
in Communications any more; machines don't care if they have an
audience. Sudden clanking reverberates through Beebe Station and
Clarke stands alone in the lounge, waiting for the ceiling to open
up. Compressed nitrox hisses overhead, blowing seawater back to the
abyss. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
hatch drops open. Green incandescence spills into the room. He climbs
down the ladder, diveskin sealed, only his face exposed. His eyes,
already capped, are featureless glass balls. But they are not as dead
as they should be, somehow. Something stares through those blank
lenses, and it almost <i>shines</i>. His blind eyes scan the
compartment like radar dishes. They lock onto hers: &quot;You're
Lenie Clarke?&quot; The voice is too loud, too normal. <i>We talk in
whispers here</i>, Clarke realizes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
are not alone now. Lubin, Brander, Caraco have appeared at the edges
of her vision, drifting into the room like indifferent wraiths. They
take up positions around the edge of the lounge, waiting. Fischer's
replacement doesn't seem to notice them. &quot;I'm Acton,&quot; he
tells Clarke. &quot;And I bring gifts from the overworld. Behold!&quot;
He extends his clenched fist, opens it palm up. Clarke sees five
metal cylinders there, each no more than two centimeters long. Acton
turns slowly, theatrically, showing his trinkets to the other
Rifters. &quot;One for each of you,&quot; he says. &quot;They go into
your chest, right next to the seawater intake.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Overhead,
the docking hatch swings shut. From behind it a postcoital tattoo,
metal on metal, heralds the shuttle's escape to the surface. They
wait there for a few moments: Rifters, newcomer, five new gadgets to
dilute their humanity a little further. Finally, Clarke reaches out
to touch one. &quot;What do they do?&quot; she says, her voice
neutral. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
snaps his fingers shut, stares about the lounge with eyeless
intensity. &quot;Why, Ms. Clarke,&quot; he replies, &quot;They tell
us when we're dead.&quot;</font></font></p>

Communications, Acton spills his trinkets onto a control console.
Clarke stands behind him, filling the cubby. Caraco and Brander look
in through the hatchway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
has disappeared.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
program's only four months old,&quot; Acton says, &quot;and it's lost
two people at Piccard, one each at Cousteau and Link, and Fischer
makes five. Not the kind of record you want to trumpet to the world,
eh?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nobody
says anything. Clarke and Brander stand impassive; Caraco shifts on
her feet. Acton sweeps his blank shiny eyes over them all. &quot;Christ
but you're a lively lot. You sure Fischer's the only one down here
who cashed in?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;These
things are supposed to save our lives?&quot; Clarke asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nah.
They don't care <i>that</i> much about us. These just help you find
the bodies.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
turns to the console, plays it with practiced fingers. The
topographic display flashes to life on the main screen. &quot;Mmmm.&quot;
Acton traces along the luminous contours with one finger. &quot;So
this is Beebe here in the center, and this must be the rift
properJesus, there's a lot of geography out here.&quot; He
points at a cluster of hard green rectangles halfway to the edge of
the screen. &quot;These are the generators?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
nods.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
picks up one of the little cylinders. &quot;They say they've already
sent down the software for these things.&quot; Silence. &quot;Well, I
guess we'll find out, won't we?&quot; He fingers the object in his
hand, presses one end of it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Beebe
Station screams aloud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
jerks back at the sound; her head cracks painfully against an
overhead pipe. The station continues to howl, wordless and
despairing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
touches a control; the scream stops as if guillotined.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
glances at the others, shaken. They appear unmoved. Of course. For
the first time she wonders what their eyes would show, naked.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,&quot;
Acton says, &quot;we know the audio alarm works. But you get a visual
signal too.&quot; He points at the screen: dead center, within the
phosphor icon that is Beebe, a crimson dot pulses like a heart under
glass.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
keys on myoelectricity in the chest,&quot; he explains. &quot;Goes
off automatically if your heart stops.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Behind
her, Clarke feels Brander turning for the hatchway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
my etiquette is out of date&quot; Acton says. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
voice is suddenly very quiet. Nobody else seems to notice.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;but
I've always thought it wasrudeto walk away when
someone's talking to you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
no obvious threat in the words. Acton's tone seems pleasant enough.
It doesn't matter. In an instant Clarke sees all the signs again; the
reasoned words, the deadened voice, the sudden slight tension of a
body rising to critical mass. Something familiar is growing behind
Acton's eyecaps.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Brander,&quot;
she says quietly, &quot;why don't you hang around and hear the man
out?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Behind
her, the sounds of motion stop.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Before
her, Acton relaxes ever so slightly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Within
her, something deeper than the Rift stirs in its sleep. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
a snap to install,&quot; Acton says. &quot;It takes about five
minutes. GA says deadman switches are standard issue from now on.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
know you</i>, she thinks. <i>I don't remember but I'm sure I've seen
you before somewhere...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
tiny knot forms in her stomach. Acton smiles at her, as though
sending some secret greeting.</font></font></p>

is about to be baptized. Clarke is looking forward to it. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
stand together in the airlock, their diveskins clinging like shadows.
The deadman switch, newly installed, itches in Clarke's chest. She
remembers the first time she dropped into the ocean this way,
remembers the person who held her hand through that drowning ordeal. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That
person is gone now. The deep sea broke her and spat her out. Clarke
wonders if it will do the same to Acton.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
floods the airlock.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">By
now the feeling is almost sensual; her insides folding flat, the
ocean rushing into her, cold and unstoppable like a lover. At 4°C
the Pacific slides through the plumbing in her chest, anesthetizing
the parts of her that can still feel. The water rises over her head;
her eyecaps show her the submerged walls of the lock with crystal
precision. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
not like that with Acton. He's trying to fall in on himself; he only
falls into Clarke. She senses his panic, watches him convulse, sees
his knees buckle in a space far too narrow to permit collapse. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>He
needs more room</i>, she thinks, smiling to herself, and opens the
outer hatch. They drop.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
glides down and out, arcing away from under Beebe's oppressive bulk.
She leaves the floodlit circle behind, skims into the welcoming
darkness with her headlight doused. She feels the presence of the
seabed a couple of meters beneath her. She's free again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
a few moments she remembers Acton. She turns back the way she came.
Beebe's floodlamps stain the darkness with dirty light; the station,
bloated and angular, pulls against the cables holding it down. Light
pours from its lower surface like feeble rocket exhaust. Pinned
face-down in that glare, Acton lies unmoving on the bottom. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Reluctantly,

doesn't move.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Acton?&quot;
She's back in the light now. Her shadow cuts him in half.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At
last he looks up. &quot;It'ssss&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
seems surprised by the sound of his own transmuted voice.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
puts his hand to his throat. &quot;I'm notbreathing&quot;
he buzzes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't answer. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
looks back down. There's something on the bottom, a few centimeters
from his face. Clarke drifts closer; a tiny shrimplike creature
trembles on the substrate.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
is it?&quot; Acton asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Something
from the surface. It must have come down on the 'scaphe.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
it'sdancing&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
sees. The jointed legs flex and snap, the carapace arches to some
insane inner rhythm. It seems so brittle a life; perhaps the next
spasm, or the next, will shatter it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
a seizure,&quot; she says after a while. &quot;It doesn't belong
here. The pressure makes the nerves fire too fast, or something.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
doesn't that happen to us?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Maybe
it does</i>. &quot;Our implants. They pump us full of neuroinhibitors
whenever we go outside.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh.
Right,&quot; Acton buzzes softly. Gently, he reaches out to the
creature. Takes it in the palm of his hand.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Crushes
it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
hits him from behind. Acton bounces off the seabed, his hand flying
open; fragments of shell, of watery flesh swirl in the water. He
kicks, rights himself, stares at Clarke without speaking. His eyecaps
shine almost yellow in the light.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
asshole,&quot; Clarke says very quietly. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
didn't belong here,&quot; Acton buzzes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Neither
do we.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
was suffering. You said so yourself.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
said the nerves fired too fast, Acton. Nerves carry pleasure as well
as pain. How do you know it wasn't dancing for fucking <i>joy</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
pushes off the bottom and kicks furiously into the abyss. She wants
to reach into Acton's body and tear everything out, sacrifice that
gory tangle of viscera and machinery to the monsters at the rift. She
can't remember ever being so angry. She tells herself she doesn't
know why.</font></font></p>

is on Brander, left fist swinging like a bolo on the end of his arm,
once twice three times and Brander is on the floor, bleeding. Acton's
bringing his foot back when Lenie gets in front of him, her hands
raised to protect herself, crying &quot;Stop it stop it's not his
fault!&quot; but somehow it's not Acton she's pleading with it's
something inside of him coming out, and she'd do anything if it would
only please God go back where it came from</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
stares through Acton's milky eyes and snarls, &quot;The fucker saw it

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
shakes her head. &quot;Maybe not. You know how dark it is out there,
I've been down here longer than anyone and they sneak up on me all
the time, Acton. Why would Brander want to hurt you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
hears Brander coming to his feet behind her. His voice carries over
her shoulder: &quot;Brander sure as shit wants to hurt him <i>n</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
cuts him off. &quot;Look, I can handle this.&quot; Her words are for
Brander; her eyes remain locked with Acton's. &quot;Maybe you should
go to Medical, make sure you're okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Since

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's

think of an answer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nah.
It wasn't that tough. I was surprised how feeble it was, after I got
over the <i>size</i> of the fucking thing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
ripped your diveskin. If it could do that, it wasn't as weak as you

you say so. Although I'll bet Brander needs Medical more than I do.&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
might also consider reining in your temper,&quot; she says as he
brushes past.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
stops. &quot;Yeah. I was kind of hard on him, wasn't I?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,&quot;

hours later Acton's in Medical. Clarke passes the open hatchway and
glances in; he sits on an examination table, his 'skin undone to the

through the hatch.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
has opened himself up. She can see the flesh peeled back around the
water intake, the places where meat turns to plastic, the tubes that
carry blood and the ones that carry antifreeze. He holds a tool in

tip whirring quietly.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
shakes his head. &quot;No. No, it just bruised my leg a bit. I'm just
making some adjustments.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Adjustments?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fine-tuning.&quot;
He smiles. &quot;Settling-in stuff.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
doesn't work. The smile is hollow, somehow. Muscles stretch lips in
the usual way, but the gesture's imprisoned in the lower half of his
face. Above it, his capped eyes stare cold as drifted snow, innocent
of any topography. She wonders why it has never bothered her before,
and realizes that this is the first time she's ever seen a Rifter
smile.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fine-tuning.
We're supposed to be self-adjusting.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Exactly.
I'm adjusting myself.&quot;</font></font></p>

sealing himself. He shrugs back into his 'skin, seals that as well.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'll

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,
the Pompeii worms can predict them. The clams and brachyurans can
predict them. Why not me?&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks around. The clams are acting just like clams. The worms are
acting just like worms. The brachyurans scurry around the bottom the
way brachyurans always do. &quot;React how?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Makes
sense, after all. These vents can feed them or parboil them. After a

drifts closer. &quot;You know, when they first sent me down here I

knuckle down and do my time and get out. But it's not like that. You

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I

dredges her memory for some sort of defense. &quot;You couldn't have

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An

circles, glowing emerald. Beebe Station sits on the bullseye.
Intermittent blobs of weaker light litter the display: fissures and
jagged rock outcroppings, endless muddy plains, the Euclidean

leans back in her chair. The back of her head touches the rear wall

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,

changes in Caraco's stance. Clarke can't be sure, but the other

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
continues, more gently. &quot;You're not worried about the rest of

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
stares at the display. &quot;What's he <i>doing</i> out there?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know,&quot; Clarke says. She wonders, not for the first time,
if Caraco really belongs down here. She just doesn't seem to get it,
sometimes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
was wondering if you could maybe talk to him,&quot; Caraco says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Acton?
Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nothing.
Forget it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;
Clarke rises from the Communications chair. Caraco backs out of the
hatchway to let her past.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Um,

watches her steadily.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't understand,&quot; Clarke says, her voice absolutely level.
&quot;It's not how much shit you've raised that suits you for the

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry.&quot; Caraco manages, with eyes utterly devoid of feeling, to
look abashed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
softens a bit. &quot;In my case,&quot; she says, &quot;Mostly I just
learned to roll with the punches. I haven't done much worth bragging
about, you know?&quot;</font></font></p>

doesn't know how it could have happened so fast. He's been here only
two weeks, yet the 'lock can barely contain his eagerness to get

outside.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
coasts out from under the station, his trajectory an effortless

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Except
Fischer, maybe. And Fischer was lost long before he came down here<i>.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
what happened to Fischer, anyway?&quot; Acton says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
chill starts in her chest, reaches her fingers before the sound of
Acton's voice has died away. <i>It's a coincidence. It's a perfectly
normal question to ask.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
said&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
disappeared,&quot; Clarke says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
told me that much,&quot; Acton buzzes back. &quot;I thought you might
have a bit more insight.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
he fell asleep outside. Maybe something ate him.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
doubt that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Really?
And what makes you such an expert, Acton? You've been down here for
what, two weeks now?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Only
two weeks? Seems longer. Time stretches when you're outside, doesn't
it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;At
first,&quot; Clarke says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know why Fischer disappeared?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
outlived his usefulness.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah.&quot;
Her machine parts turn it into half creak, half growl. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
serious, Lenie.&quot; Acton's mechanical voice does not change. &quot;You
think they're going to let you stay down here forever? You think
they'd let people like us down here at all if they had any choice?&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
stops kicking. Her body continues to coast. &quot;What are you
talking about?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Use
your head, Lenie. You're smarter than I am, inside at least. You've
got the keys to the city hereyou've got the keys to the whole
fucking seaboard, and you're still acting like a victim.&quot;
Acton's vocoder gurgles indecipherablya laugh, mistransposed?
A snarl? </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">More
words: &quot;They count on that, you know.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
starts kicking again, stares ahead to the brightening glow of the
Throat.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
isn't there.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a moment's disorientation  <i>We can't be lost, we were headed
right for it, has the power gone out?</i>  before she sees the
familiar streak of coarse yellow light, bearing four o'clock.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>How
could I have gotten turned around like that?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're
here,&quot; Acton says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
The Throat's way over&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
nova flares beside her, drenching the abyss with blinding light. It
takes Clarke's eyecaps a moment to adjust; when the starbursts have
faded from her eyes, the ocean is a muddy black backdrop for the
bright cone from Acton's headlamp.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't,&quot;
she says. &quot;It gets so dark when you do that, you can't see
anything&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know. I'll turn it off in a moment. Just look.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
beam shines down on a small rocky outcropping rising from the mud, no
more than two meters across. Jagged cookie-cutter flowers litter its
surface, radial clusters shining garish red and blue in the
artificial light. Some of them lie flat along the rock face. Others
are contorted into frozen calcareous knots, clenched around things
Clarke can't see.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Some
of them move, slowly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
brought me out here to look at starfish?&quot; She tries, and fails,
to squeeze some hint of bored contempt through the vocodor. But
inside there's a distant, frightened amazement that he <i>has</i> led
her here, that she could be guided, utterly unsuspecting, so
completely off course. <i>And how did he find this place? No sonar
pistol, compass doesn't work worth shit this close to the Throat...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
figured you probably hadn't looked at them very closely before,&quot;
Acton says. &quot;I thought you might be interested.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
don't have time for this, Acton.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
hands reach down into the light and lock onto one of the starfish.
They peel it slowly from the rock; there are filaments of some kind
along the creature's underside, anchoring it to the substrate.
Acton's efforts tear them free, a few at a time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
holds the animal up for Clarke's inspection. Its upper surface is
colored stone, encrusted with calcareous spicules. Acton flips it
over. The underside writhes with hundreds of thick squirming threads,
jammed into dense rows along the length of each arm. Each thread has
a tiny sucker at its tip.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
starfish,&quot; Acton tells her, &quot;is the ultimate democracy.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stares, quietly repelled.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;This
is how they move,&quot; Acton is saying. &quot;They walk along on all
these tube feet. But the weird thing is, they have no brains at all.
Not surprising for a democracy.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rows
of squirming maggots. A forest of translucent leeches, groping
blindly into the water.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
there's nothing to coordinate the tube feet, they all move
independently. Usually that's not a problem; they all tend to go
towards food, for example. But it's not unusual for a third of these
feet to be pulling in some other direction entirely. The whole
animal's a living tug-o-war. Sometimes, some really stubborn tube
feet just don't give up, and they literally get torn out at the roots
when the others move the body someplace they don't want to go. But
hey: majority rules, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
extends a tentative finger. Half a dozen tube feet latch onto it. She
can't feel them through her 'skin. Anchored, they look almost
delicate, like filaments of milky glass.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
that's nothing,&quot; Acton says. &quot;Watch this.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
rips the starfish in half.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
pulls back, shocked and angry. But there's something in Acton's
posture, in that barely visible outline behind his lamp, that makes
her pause.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
worry, Lenie,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven't killed it. I've <i>bred</i>
it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
drops the torn halves. They flutter like leaves to the seabed,
trailing bits of bloodless entrail.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
regenerate. Didn't you know that? You can tear them into pieces and
each piece grows back the missing parts. It takes time, but they
recover. Only you end up with more of them. Damn hard to kill these
guys.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Understand,
Lenie? Tear them to pieces, they come back stronger.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
do you know all this?&quot; she asks in a metallic whisper. &quot;Where
do you come from?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
lays an icy black hand on her arm. &quot;Right here. This is where I
was born.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't think it absurd. In fact, she barely hears him. Her mind is
somewhere else entirely, terrified by a sudden realization.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
is touching her, and she doesn't mind.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" align="CENTER" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Of
course, the sex is electric. It always is. The familiar has
reasserted itself, here in the cramped space of Clarke's cubby. They
can't both lie on the pallet at the same time but they manage
somehow, Acton on his knees, then Clarke, squirming around each other
in a metal nest lined with ducts and vents and bundles of optical
cabling. They navigate each others' seams and scars, tonguing puckers
of metal and pale flesh, unseen and all-seeing behind their corneal
armor. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For
Clarke it's a new twist, this icy ecstasy of a lover without eyes.
For the first time she feels no need to avert her face, no threat to
fragile intimacy; at first, when Acton moved to take out his caps,
she stopped him with a touch and a whisper and he seemed to
understand. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
cannot lie together afterwards so they sit side-by-side, leaning into
each other, staring at the hatch two meters in front of them. The
lights are turned too low for dryback vision; Clarke and Acton see a
room suffused in pale fluorescence.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
reaches out and fingers a shard of glass sticking from an empty frame
on one wall. &quot;There used to be a mirror here,&quot; he remarks. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
nibbles his shoulder. &quot;There were mirrors everywhere. Itook
them down.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why?
A few mirrors would open the place up a bit. Make it larger.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
points. Several torn wires, fine as threads, hang from a hole in the
frame. &quot;They had cameras behind them. I didn't like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
grunts. &quot;I don't blame you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
sit without speaking for a bit.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
said something outside,&quot; she says. &quot;You said you were born
down here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
hesitates, then nods. &quot;Ten days ago.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
did you mean?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
should know,&quot; he says. &quot;You witnessed my birth.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
thinks back. &quot;That was when the gulper got you...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Close.&quot;
Acton grins his cold eyeless grin, puts an arm around her. &quot;Actually,
the gulper sort of catalyzed it, if I remember. Think of it as a
midwife.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An
image pops into her mind: Acton in Medical, vivisecting himself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fine-tuning,&quot;
she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot; He gives her a squeeze. &quot;And I've got you to thank
for it. You gave me the idea.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
were my mother, Len. And my father was this spastic little shrimp
that ended up way over its head. He died before I was born, actually:
I killed him. You weren't very happy about that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shakes her head. &quot;You're not making sense.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
telling me you haven't noticed the change? You telling me I'm the
same person I was when I came down?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe I've just gotten to know you
better.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe.
Maybe I have too. I don't know, Len, I just seem more...<i>awake</i>
now, I guess. I see things differently. You must have noticed.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,
but only when you're&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Outside.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
did something to your inhibitors,&quot; she whispers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Reduced
the dosage a bit.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
grasps his arm. &quot;Karl, those chemicals keep you from spazzing
out every time you go outside. You fuck with this stuff, you're
risking a seizure as soon as the 'lock floods.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
<i>have</i> been fucking with it, Lenie. You see any change in me
that isn't an improvement?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't answer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
all about action potential,&quot; he tells her. &quot;Your nerves
have to build up a certain charge before they can fire&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
at this depth they'd fire all the time, Karl, please&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Shh.&quot;
He lays a gentle finger on her lips but she brushes it away, suddenly
angry.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
serious, Karl. Without those drugs your nerves short-circuit, you
burn out, I <i>know</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
only know what they tell you,&quot; he snaps. &quot;Why don't you try
working things out yourself for once?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
falls silent, stung by his disapproval. A space opens between them on
the pallet. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not a fool, Lenie,&quot; Acton says, more quietly. &quot;I just
reduced the settings a bit. Five percent. Now, when I go outside it
takes a bit less of a stimulus for my nerves to fire, that's all.
It...it wakes you up, Len; I'm more aware of things, I'm more alive
somehow.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
watches him, unspeaking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Of
course they <i>say</i> it's dangerous,&quot; he says. &quot;They're
scared shitless of you already. You think they're going to give you
even more of an edge?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
not scared of us, Karl.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
should be.&quot; His arm goes back around her. &quot;Wanna try it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
as though she's suddenly outside, still naked. &quot;No.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There's
nothing to worry about, Len. I've already done the guinea pig work on
myself. Open up to me and I could make the adjustments myself, it'd
take ten minutes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not up for it, Karl. Not yet, anyway. Maybe one of the others is.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He

don't.&quot; He grins, showing teeth as sharp and white as eyecaps.
&quot;But even if they did trust me, they wouldn't do anything unless
you thought it was okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks at him. &quot;Why not?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
in charge here, Len.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bullshit.
They never told you that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
didn't have to. It's obvious.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shakes her head. She searches her memory for something, anything,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Think
about it, anyway,&quot; Acton whispers in her ear. &quot;I guarantee
you'll feel twice as alive as you do now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
happens anyway,&quot; Clarke reminds him. &quot;Whenever I go
outside. I don't need to screw up my internals for that.&quot; <i>Not
those internals, anyway.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;This
is different,&quot; he insists.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks at him and smiles, and hopes he doesn't push it. <i>How can he
expect me to let him cut me open like that?</i> she wonders, and then
wonders if maybe someday she will, if the fear of losing him might
somehow grow large enough to force her other fears into submission.
It wouldn't be the first time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Twice
as alive, Acton says. Hiding behind her smile, Clarke considers:
twice as much of her life. Not a great prospect, so far.</font></font></p>

course she wakes up alone. They still try to sleep together
sometimes, after sex has made them too lazy to go outside. But the
bunk is too small. The most they can manage is a sort of diagonal
slouch: feet on the floor, necks bent up against the bulkhead, Acton
cradling her like a living hammock. If they're unlucky they really do
fall asleep like that. It takes hours to get the kinks out
afterwards. Way more trouble than it's worth.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So
she wakes up alone. But she misses him anyway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
early. The schedules handed down from the GA are increasingly
irrelevant  circadian rhythms lose their way in the incessant
darkness, fall slowly out of phase  but the rubbery timetable
that remains leaves hours before her shift starts. Lenie Clarke is
awake in the middle of the night. It seems like a stupid and obvious
thing to say, months from the nearest sunrise, but right now it seems
especially true.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In
the corridor she turns for a moment in the direction of his cubby
before she remembers. He's never in there any more. He's never even
inside, unless he's eating or working or being with her. He hasn't
slept in his quarters almost since they got involved. He's getting
almost as bad as Lubin.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco

picks him up fifty meters southeast, barely echoing above the bottom

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
smoker, way off in one corner of the Throat. It had this weird fluted

curled up when Clarke reaches him, knees tucked under his chin,

days since she's slept outside. Two days since she decided to
incarcerate herself in here. She goes outside to work, and comes back
as soon as each shift ends. No one's mentioned the change to her.
Perhaps no one's noticed; if they don't come back to Beebe themselves
after work, they scatter off across the sea bed to do whatever they
do in splendid, freezing isolation. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
knew Acton would notice, though. He'd notice, and miss her, and
follow her back inside. Or maybe he'd try and talk her back out,
fight with her when she resisted. But he's shown no sign at all. He
spends as much time out there as he ever did. She still sees him, of
course. At mealtimes. At the library. Once for sex, during which
neither spoke of anything important. And then gone again, back into
the ocean.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
didn't enter into any pact with her. She didn't even tell him about
her pact with herself. Still, she feels betrayed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
needs him. She knows what that means, sees her own footprints
crowding the road ahead, but reading the signs and changing course
are two completely different things. Her insides are twisting with
the need to go, whether out to him or just <i>out</i> she can't say.
But as long as he's outside and she's in Beebe, Lenie Clarke can tell
herself that she's still in control.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
progress, sort of.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now,
curled up in her cubby with the hatch sealed tight, she hears the
subterranean gurgle of the airlock. She comes up off the bed as
though radio-controlled.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Noises,
flesh against metal, hydraulics and pneumatics. A voice. Lenie Clarke
is on her way to the wet room.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
brought a monster inside with him. It's an anglerfish, almost two
meters long, a jellylike bag of flesh with teeth half the length of
Clarke's forearm. It lies quivering on the deck, its insides exploded
through its own mouth in the near vacuum of Beebe's sea-level
atmosphere. Dozens of miniature tails, twitching feebly, sprout
everywhere from its body.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
and Lubin, in the middle of some task, look over from the engineering
'lock. Acton stands beside his catch; his thorax, still inflating,
hisses softly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
did you fit it inside the 'lock?&quot; Clarke wonders.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;More
to the point,&quot; Lubin says, coming over, &quot;why bother?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What're

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
leans forward. Not just tails, she sees now; some of them have those
extra fins along the side and back. Some of them have gills. A couple
of them even have eyes. It's as though a whole school of tiny anglers
are boring into this big one. Some are in only as far as their jaws,
but others are buried right down to the tail.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another
thought strikes her, even more revolting; the big fish doesn't need
its mouth any more. It's just <i>engulfing</i> the little ones across
its body wall, like some giant devolving microbe.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Group
sex on the rift,&quot; says Acton. &quot;All the big ones we've been
seeing, they're female. The males are these little finger-sized
fuckers here. Not many dating opportunities this far down, so they
just latch on to the first female they can find, and they sort of
<i>fuse </i> their heads get absorbed, their bloodstreams link
together. They're parasites, get it? They worm into her side and they
spend their whole lives feeding off her. And there's a fuck of a lot
of them, but she's bigger than they are, she's stronger, she could
eat them alive if she just&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He's
been in the library again,&quot; Caraco remarks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
looks at her for a moment. Deliberately, he points at the bloated
carcass on the deck. &quot;That's us.&quot; He grabs one of the
parasitic males, rips it free. &quot;This is everyone else. Get it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
takes a single step towards the other man. &quot;Lubin, I am getting

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Really.&quot;

moves; not directly between them, just off to one side, forming the
apex of a human triangle. She has absolutely no idea what to do if
this comes to blows. She has no idea what to say to stop that from
happening.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Suddenly,

on, you guys.&quot; Caraco leans back against the drying rack. &quot;Can't
you settle this some other way? Maybe you could just whip out a ruler
and compare your dicks or something.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
was looking for Karl Acton, but somehow she's found Gerry Fischer
instead. He looks sadly down at her through the length of a long
tunnel. He seems to be a whole ocean away. He doesn't speak but she
senses sadness, disappointment. <i>You lied to me</i>, that feeling
says. <i>You said you'd come and see me and you lied. You've
forgotten all about me.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't say it aloud, of course, but somehow he reacts to it anyway.
His feelings change; sadness fades, something colder seeps up in its
place, something so deep and so old that she can't think of words to
describe it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something

calm down. It's me.&quot; Acton's silhouette hangs against a faint

pushes gently at his chest. Says nothing.</font></font></p>

was&quot; She feels a vestige of disquiet, but she can't
remember what to attach it to. &quot;I must have drifted off. I was
dreaming. It's been so long since I slept out here, I&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Four

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
you could have come inside.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
nods. &quot;I tried. But I could never get all of me through the
airlock, and the part that I could well, it was sort of a poor

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

And I know you like it out here as much as I do. Sometimes I feel
like I could just stay out here forever.&quot; He pauses for a
moment, as if weighing alternatives. &quot;Fischer's got it right.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
often. He's pretty skittish.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
doesn't answer for a moment. &quot;I don't know. I just got that

hangs around out there and watches us. I don't know if he's what we'd

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He

knows we're together. I think...I think he figures that connects me

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Oh
yes. It always starts off so innocently. <i>You cared about him,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
waits and watches.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know there was nothing going on. And even if there was, I know it's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Now
that I think about it, that's always been my problem,&quot; Acton
muses. &quot;I always had to go on what other people told me, and
people people lie all the time, Len, you know that. So no
matter how many times she swears she's not fucking around on you, or
even that she doesn't <i>want</i> to fuck around on you, how can you
ever really <i>know</i>? You can't. So the default assumption is,
she's lying. And being lied to all the time, that's a damn good
reason for  well, for doing what I do sometimes.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Karl

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know <i>you</i> don't lie to me. You don't even hate me. That's kind

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
reaches out to touch the side of his face. &quot;I'd say that's a

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
Len, I don't <i>have</i> to trust you. I just <i>know</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm

changes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
waits for her to respond.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
are you saying, Karl?&quot; she says at last. &quot;Are you saying

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
Nothing like that. I just, well, I identify with you more. I can

not. Stay a while. Spend the night.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Karl,
has it ever occurred to you that you might be developing some sort of
dependence on this nerve rush of yours?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Come
on, Len. The rift gives us all a rush. That's why we're down here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
get a rush because we're fucked in the head. That doesn't mean we

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
nods. &quot;I know.&quot;</font></font></p>

please, please try it my way. Try sleeping inside again, just for a

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe.
I don't know. I just  I just don't know how to deal with you

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;When

Clarke feels Acton tensing; it's like a small shockwave pushed out by
his clenching muscles, a pulse of tension that ripples through the
air and breaks against her 'skin. She rests one calming hand casually
on his thigh, under the table. It's a calculated risk, of course. It
would piss him off even more if Acton thought he was being
patronized.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hallelujah.&quot;
Acton brings his hands together in sarcastic applause. &quot;The

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
leans back in his chair. &quot;Give it a rest, Acton. Haven't you
ever worked for the GA before? You ever work for <i>any</i> sort of
bureaucracy?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
looks back with a hint of a sneer on his face. &quot;My point, <i>Karl</i>,
is that you're reading way too much into this. So they made the
ceilings too low. So their interior decorator's not worth shit. So
what else is new? The GA just isn't that scared of you.&quot; He
takes in Beebe with a wave of his arm. &quot;This isn't some subtle
psychological war. Beebe was just designed by incompetent bozos.&quot;
Brander stands up, takes his plate to the galley. &quot;If you don't
like the headroom, stay outside.&quot; </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton

hunched over the library terminal, 'phones on his ears, 'phones on
his eyes, the flatscreen blanked as usual to hide his litsearch from

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
learned not to bother him when he's like this. He's hunting in there,
he resents any distraction as though the files he's after might
somehow escape if he looks the other way. She doesn't touch him. She
doesn't run a gentle finger along his arm or try to work the knots
from his shoulders. Not any more. There are some mistakes that Lenie
Clarke can learn from.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
actually helpless in a strange way; cut off from the rest of Beebe,
deaf and blind to the presence of people who are by no means friends.
Brander could come up behind him right now and plant a knife in his
back. And yet everyone leaves him alone. It's as though his sensory
exile, this self-imposed vulnerability is some sort of brazen dare
that no one has the guts to take him up on. So Acton sits at the
keyboard tapping at first, now stabbing in his own
private datasphere, and his deaf blind presence somehow dominates the
lounge out of all proportion to his physical size.</font></font></p>

tears the 'phones from his face and slams his fist down on the

magnetic chassis whose face and name never mattered because it would
change without warning. And providing continuity, riding along behind
each twinkling pair of eyes, there's always been the thing inside,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This
time they hear her. The struggle slows, pauses; fists remain poised,
no holds break, but they're all looking at her now.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Even
Acton. Clarke looks up into his eyes, looks behind them. She can see
nothing staring back but Acton himself. <i>You were there before,</i>
she remembers. <i>I'm almost sure of it. Count on you to get Acton
into a losing fight and then bugger off...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
braces herself against the bulkhead and pushes slowly erect. Caraco
moves aside, helps her up.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
flattered by all the attention, folks,&quot; Clarke says, &quot;and I
want to thank you for stopping by, but I think we can handle this on
our own from here on in.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
puts a protective hand on her shoulder. &quot;You don't have to put
up with this shit.&quot; Her eyes, somehow venomous through the
shielding, are still locked on Acton. &quot;None of us do.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
corner of Acton's mouth pulls back in a small, bloody sneer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
endures Caraco's touch without flinching. &quot;I know that. And
thanks for stepping in. But please, just leave us alone for a while.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
doesn't loosen his grip on Acton's throat. &quot;I don't think that a
very good&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Will
you get your fucking hands off him and leave us alone!</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
back off. Clarke glares after them, dogs the hatch to keep them out.
&quot;Goddamned nosy neighbors,&quot; she grumbles, turning back to
Acton.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
body sags in the sudden privacy, all the anger and bravado
evaporating as she watches.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Want
to tell me why you're being such an asshole?&quot; she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
collapses on her pallet. He stares at the deck, avoiding her eyes.
&quot;Don't you know when you're being fucked over?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
sits down beside him. &quot;Sure. Getting punched out is pretty much
a giveaway.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
trying to <i>help</i> you. I'm trying to help <i>all</i> of you.&quot;
He turns and hugs her, body shaking, cheek pressed against hers, face
aimed at the bulkhead behind her shoulder. &quot;Oh God Lenie I'm so
sorry you're the last person in the whole fucking world I want to
hurt&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
strokes him without speaking. She knows he means it. They always do.
She still can't bring herself to blame any of them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>He
thinks he's alone in there. He thinks it's all his own doing.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Briefly,
an impossible thought: <i>Maybe it is...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
can't go on with this,&quot; he says. &quot;Staying inside.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It'll
get better, Karl. It's always hard at first.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh
God, Len. You don't have a clue. You still think I'm some sort of
junkie.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Karl&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
think I don't know what addiction is? You think I can't tell the
difference?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't answer. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
manages a small, sad laugh. &quot;I'm losing it, Len. You're forcing
me to lose it. Why in God's name do you want me this way?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Because
this is who you are, Karl. Outside isn't you. Outside's a
distortion.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Outside
I'm not an asshole. Outside I don't make everyone hate me.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;
She hugs him. &quot;If controlling your temper means seeing you turn
into something else, seeing you doped up all the time, then I'll take
my chances with the original.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
looks at her. &quot;I hate this. Jesus Christ, Len. Won't you ever
get tired of people who kick the shit out of you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
a really nasty thing to say,&quot; she remarks quietly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't think so. I can remember some things I saw out there, Len. It's
like you need I mean God, Lenie, there's so much <i>hate</i>
in all of you...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
never heard him speak like this. Not even outside. &quot;You've got a
bit of that in you too, you know.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.
I thought it made me different. I thought it gave me...an edge, you
know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
does.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
shakes his head. &quot;Oh, no. Not next to you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
underrate yourself. You don't see me trying to take on the whole
station.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
just it, Len. I blow it off all the time, I waste it on stupid shit
like this. But you you hoard it.&quot; His expression changes,
she's not exactly sure what to. Concern, maybe. Worry. &quot;Sometimes
you scare me more than Lubin does. You never lash out, or beat on
anybody  Christ, it's a major event when you even raise your
voice  so it just builds up. It's got its up side, I guess.&quot;
He manages a soft laugh. &quot;Hatred's a great fuel source. If
anything everactivated you, you'd be unstoppable. But now,
you're justtoxic. I don't think you really know how much hate
you've got in you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Pity?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
inside her goes suddenly cool. &quot;Don't play therapist with me,
Karl. Just because your nerves fire too fast doesn't mean you've got
second sight. You don't know me that well.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Of
course not. Or you wouldn't be with me.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
in here.&quot; He smiles, but that strange sick expression keeps
showing through behind. &quot;Outside, at least, I can see things. In
here I'm blind.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
in the land of the blind.&quot; She says curtly. &quot;It's not a
drawback.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Really?
Would <i>you</i> stay here if it meant getting your eyes cut out?
Would you stay some place that rotted your brain out piece by piece,
turned you from a human being into a fucking monkey?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
considers. &quot;If I was a monkey to begin with, maybe.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Uh
oh. Sounded too flippant by half, didn't I?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
looks at her for a moment. Something else does too, drowsily, with
one eye open.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;At
least <i>I</i> don't get my endorphins by playing victim,&quot; he
says, slowly. &quot;You should really be a bit more careful who you
choose to look down on.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
you,&quot; Clarke replies, &quot;should save the pious lectures for
those rare occasions when you actually know what you're talking
about.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
rises off the bed and glares at her, fists carefully unclenched.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
does not move. She feels her whole body hardening from the inside
out. She deliberately lifts her head until she's looking straight
into Acton's hooded eyes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
in there now, fully awake. She can't see Acton at all any more.
Everything's back to normal.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
even try,&quot; she says. &quot;I gave you a couple of shots for old
times' sake, but if you lay a hand on me again I swear I'll fucking
kill you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
marvels inwardly at the strength in her voice; it sounds like iron.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
stare at each other for an endless moment.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton's
body turns on its heel and undogs the hatch. Clarke watches it step
out of the cubby; Caraco, waiting in the corridor, lets it by without
a word. Clarke holds herself utterly still until she hears the 'lock
beginning to cycle.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>He
didn't call my bluff.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Except
this time, she's not sure that that's all it was.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
doesn't see her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
been days since they've said anything to each other. Even their shift
schedules have diverged. Tonight, as she was trying to sleep, she
heard him come out of the abyss again and climb up into the lounge
like some invading sea creature. He does it now and then when the
place is deserted, when everyone is either outside or sealed into
their cubicles. He sits there at the library, diving through his
'phones down endless virtual avenues, desperation in every movement.
It's as though he has to hold his breath whenever he comes inside;
once she saw him tear the headset off his skull and flee outside as
though his chest would burst. When she picked up the abandoned
headset, the results of his litsearch were still glowing in the
eyephones. Chemistry.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another
time he turned on his way out to see her standing in the corridor. He
smiled. He even said something: &quot;<i>sorry</i>&quot;
is what she heard, but there may have been more. He didn't stay.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now
his hands rest, unmoving, on the keyboard. His shoulders are shaking.
He doesn't make any sound at all. Lenie Clarke closes her eyes for a
moment, wondering whether to approach him. When she looks again the
lounge is empty.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
can tell exactly where he's going. His icon buds off of Beebe and
crawls away across the display, and there's only on thing in that
direction. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When
she gets there he's crawling across its back, digging a hole with his
knife. Clarke's eyecaps can barely find enough light to see by, this
far from the Throat; Acton cuts and slices in the light of her
headlamp, his shadow writhing away across a horizon of dead flesh.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
dug a crater, maybe half a meter across, half a meter deep. He's cut
through the stratum of blubber below the skin and is tearing through
the brown muscle beneath. It's been months now since this creature
landed here. Clarke marvels at its preservation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>The
abyss likes extremes</i>, she muses. <i>If it isn't a pressure

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
stops digging. He just floats there, staring down at his handiwork.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
a stupid idea,&quot; he buzzes at last. &quot;I don't know what gets
into me sometimes.&quot; He turns to face her; his eyecaps reflect
yellow. &quot;I'm sorry, Lenie. I know this place was special to you
somehow, I didn't mean to...well, desecrate it, I guess.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shakes her head. &quot;It's okay. It's not important.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton's
vocoder gurgles; in air, it would be a sad laugh. &quot;I give myself
too much credit sometimes, Len. Whenever I'm inside, and I'm fucking
up and I don't know what to do, I figure all I've got to do is come
outside and the scales will fall off my eyes. It's like, religious
faith almost. All the answers. Right out here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
okay,&quot; Clarke says again, because it seems better than saying
nothing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Only
sometimes the answer doesn't really do much for you, you know?
Sometimes the answer's just: Forget it. You're fucked.&quot; Acton
looks back down at the dead whale. &quot;Would you turn the light
off?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
darkness swallows them like a blanket. Clarke reaches through it and
brings Acton to her. &quot;What were you trying to do?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That
mechanical laugh again. &quot;Something I read. I was thinking&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
cheek brushes against hers. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know what I was thinking. When I'm inside I'm a fucking lobo
case, I get these stupid ideas and even when I get back out it takes
a while before I really wake up and realize what a dork I've been. I
wanted to study an adrenal gland. Thought it would help me figure out
how to counter ion depletion at the synapse junctions.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know how to do that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
it was just bullshit anyway. I can't think straight in there.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't bother to argue.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry,&quot; Acton buzzes after a while.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
strokes his back. It feels like two sheets of plastic rubbing
together<i>.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think I can explain it to you,&quot; he adds. &quot;If you're
interested.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sure.&quot;
But she knows it won't change anything.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know how there's this strip in your brain that controls movement?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
if, say, you became a concert pianist, the part that runs your
fingers would actually spread out, take up more of the strip to meet
the increased demand for finger control. But you lose something, too.
The adjacent parts of the strip get crowded out. So maybe you
couldn't wiggle your toes or curl your tongue as well as you could
before you started practicing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton
falls silent. Clarke feels his arms, cradling her loosely from
behind.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think something like that happened to me,&quot; he says after a
while.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think something in my brain got exercised, and it spread out and
crowded some other parts away. But it only works in a high-pressure
environment, you see, it's the pressure that makes the nerves fire
faster. So when I go back inside, the new part shuts down and the old
parts have been  well, lost.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shakes her head. &quot;We've been through this, Karl. Your synapses
just ran low on calcium.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
always dreamed of water. He dreamed the smell of dead fish in rotten
nets, and rainbow puddles of gasoline shimmering off the Steveston
jetty, and a home so close to the shoreline you could barely get
insurance. He dreamed of a time when waterfront meant something, even
the muddy brown stretch where the Fraser hemorrhaged into the Strait
of Georgia. His mother was standing over him, beaming <i>a vital
ecological resource, Yves. A staging ground for migrating birds. A
filter for the whole world.</i> And little Yves Scanlon smiled back,
proud that he alone of all his friends well, not <i>friends</i>
exactly, but maybe they would be <i>now</i> would grow up
appreciating nature first-hand, right here in his new back yard. One
and a half meters above the high-tide line.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sometimes
he could postpone the inevitable. Sometimes he could fight the jolt
from his bedside dreamer, keep it from dragging him back for just a
few more seconds. Thirty years of random images would flash across
his mind in those moments; falling forests, bloating deserts,
ultraviolet fingers reaching ever deeper into barren seas. Oceans
creeping up shorelines. Vital ecological resources turning into
squatting camps for refugees. Squatting camps turning into intertidal
zones.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And

frequently reminded himself of the advantages: you didn't have to
fight and scramble for a new contract every six months. You had
stability, of a sort. If you performed. If you kept on performing.
Which meant, of course, that Yves Scanlon couldn't afford the nightly
nine-and-a-half-hours that was optimal for his species.</font></font></p>

smart gels are incapable of physical or mental distress of any sort,
they have no rights to protect regardless of their level of
self-awareness. This reasoning was eloquently summarized during the

is off the scope, probably sleeping on the bottom somewhere. They
leave him a note. Brander and Caraco are out replacing the bearings
on number six; a tremor cracked the casing last shift, jammed two
thousand kilograms of mud and grit into the works. Still, the other
generators are more than able to take up the slack. Brander and
Caraco grab their squids and join the parade.</font></font></p>

should keep our lights down,&quot; Nakata buzzes as they leave the

follow the bearing, their lights dimmed to embers, through darkness
almost impenetrable even to rifter eyes. Caraco pulls up beside
Clarke: &quot;I'm heading into the wild blue yonder after this. Wanna
come?&quot;</font></font></p>

shiver of second-hand revulsion tickles Clarke's insides; from
Nakata, of course. Nakata used to join Caraco on her daily swim up
Beebe's transponder line, until about two weeks ago. Something
happened up at the deep scattering layer  nothing dangerous,
apparently, but it left Alice absolutely cold at the prospect of
going anywhere near the surface. Caraco's been pestering the others
to pace her ever since.</font></font></p>

faint pulse of surprise from Brander, in the lead. Then from Nakata,
next in line, a split-second before Clarke herself feels a slap of
sluggish turbulence. Caraco, forewarned, barely radiates anything
when the plume washes over her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
darkness has become fractionally more absolute, the water itself more

be heard over the sound of feeding machinery.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
turn and follow the trail upstream, keeping to the plume's edge more
by touch than sight. The ambient grumble swells to full-blown
cacophony, resolves into a dozen different voices; pile-drivers,
muffled explosions, the sounds of cement mixers. Clarke can barely
think above the waterborne racket, or the rising apprehension in four
separate minds, and suddenly it's <i>right there</i>, just for a
moment, a great segmented tread climbing up around a gear wheel two
stories high, rolling away in the murk.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Jesus.</i>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
move together, aiming their squids high and cruising up at an angle.
Clarke tastes the thrill from three other sets of adrenals, adds her
own and sends it back, a vicarious feedback loop. With their lamps on
minimum the viz can't be more than three meters; even in front of
Clarke's face the world is barely more than shadows on shadows, dimly
lit by headlights bobbing to either side. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
top of the tread slides below them for a moment, a jointed moving
road several meters across. Then a plain of jumbled metal shapes,
fading into view barely ahead, fading out again almost instantly;
exhaust ports, sonar domes, flow-meter ducts. The din fades a little
as they move towards the center of the hull.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Most
of the protuberances are smoothed back into hydrodynamic teardrops.
Close up, though, there's no shortage of handholds. Caraco's
smoldering headlight is the first to settle down onto the machine;
her squid paces along above her. Clarke sets her own squid to heel
and joins the others on the hull. So far there's been no obvious
reaction to their presence.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
huddle together, heads close to converse above the ambient noise. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Where's
it from?&quot; Brander wonders.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Probably
Korea.&quot; Nakata buzzes back. &quot;I did not see any registry
markings, but it would take a long time to check the whole hull.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco:
&quot;Bet you wouldn't find anything anyway. If they were going to
risk sneaking it this far into foreign territory they wouldn't be
stupid enough to leave a return address.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
rumbling metal landscape pulls them along. A couple of meters up,
barely visible, their riderless squids trail patiently behind. </font></font>

Brander lets go for a moment, drifts back a few meters before
catching another handhold. &quot;Hey Judy, want to go exploring?&quot;</font></font></p>

moved very fast,&quot; Nakata says. There's a sudden small blot of

on, Alice. These things are robots. Besides, if there was anyone
inside we'd be able to <i>feel</i> them, right? You feel anyone other

&quot;Maybe I  it's a big machine, Lenie. Maybe the pilot is
just too far aw&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
and Caraco are plotting something. They're both out of sight 
even their squids have left to keep them in range  but they're
easily close enough for Clarke to sense a rising anticipation. She
and Nakata exchange looks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
better see what they're up to,&quot; Clarke says. The two of them
head off across the muckraker.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
few moments later, Brander and Caraco materialize in front of them.
They're crouched to either side of a metal dome about thirty
centimeters across. Several dark fisheyes stare out from its surface.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Cameras?&quot;
Clarke asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nope,&quot;
Caraco says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Photocells,&quot;
Brander adds.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
feels the beat before a punchline. &quot;Are you sure this is a
good&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Let
there be light!</i>&quot; cries Judy Caraco. Beams stab out from her
headlamp and Brander's, bathing the fisheyes at full intensity.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
muckraker stops dead. Inertia pushes Clarke forward; she grabs and
regains her balance, unexpected silence ringing in her ears. In the
wake of that incessant noise, she feels almost deaf.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Whoa,&quot;
Brander buzzes into the stillness. Something ticks through the hull
once, twice, three times.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
world lurches back into motion. The landscape rotates around them,
throws them together in a tangle of limbs. By the time they've sorted
themselves out they're accelerating. The muckraker is grumbling
again, but with a different voice; no lazy munching on polymetallics
now, just a straight beeline for international waters. Within seconds
Clarke is hanging on for dear life.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Yee-haw!</i>&quot;
Caraco shouts.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bright
light might scare it?&quot; Brander calls from somewhere behind. &quot;I
would say <i>so</i>!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Strong
feelings on all sides. Lenie Clarke tightens her grip and tries to
sort out which ones are hers. Exultation spiked with primal, giddy
fear; that's Brander and Caraco. Alice Nakata's excited almost
despite herself, but with more worry in the mix; and here, buried
somewhere down deep, almost a sense of  she can't tell,
really.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Discontent?
Unhappiness?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
really.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Is
that </i>me<i>?</i> But that doesn't feel right either. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Bright
light pins Clarke's shadow to the hull, disappears an instant later.
She looks back; Brander's up above her somehow, swinging back and
forth on a line trailing up into the water  <i>could've sworn
that wasn't there before</i>  his beam waving around like a
demented lighthouse. Ribbons of muddy water stream past just above
the deck, their edges writhing in textbook illustrations of turbulent
flow. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
pushes off the hull and flies back up into the water. Her silhouette
vanishes into the murk, but her headlamp comes to rest and starts
dipping around just behind Brander's. Clarke looks over at Nakata,
still plastered against the hull. Nakata's feeling a little sick now,
and even more worried about something...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
is not <i>happy</i>!&quot; Nakata shouts.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey;
come on, groundhogs!&quot; Caraco's voice buzzes faintly. &quot;Fly!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Discontent.
Something not expected.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Who</i>
is <i>that?</i> Clark wonders.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Come
<i>on</i>!&quot; Caraco calls again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>What
the hell. Can't hang on much longer anyway.</i> Clarke lets go,
pushes off; the top of the muckraker races on beneath. Heavy water
drags the momentum from her. She kicks for altitude, feels sudden
expectation from behind  and in the next second something
slams against her back, pushing her forward again. Implants lurch
against her ribcage.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Jesus
Christ!&quot; Brander buzzes in her ear. &quot;Get a grip, Lenie!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
caught her on his way past. Clarke reaches out and grabs the line
that he and Caraco are attached to. It's only as thick as her finger,
and too slippery to hang on to. She looks back and sees that the
other two have looped it around their chests and under their arms,
leaving their hands more or less free. She tries the same trick, drag
arching her back, while Caraco calls out to Nakata.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
is not eager to let go. They can feel that, even though they can't
see her. Brander angles back and forth, tacking his body like a
rudder; the three of them swing in a grand, barely controlled arc,
knotted into the middle of their tether. &quot;Come on, Alice! Join
the human kite! We'll catch you!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
Nakata's coming, she's coming, but she's doing it her own way. She's
climbed sideways against the current, hand over hand, until she found
the place where the line joins the deck. Now she's letting drag push
her back along the filament to them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
has finally secured herself in a loop. Speed digs the line into her
flesh; it's already starting to hurt. She doesn't feel much like a
human kite. Bait on a hook is more like it. She twists around to
Brander, points at the line: &quot;What <i>is</i> this, anyway?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;VLF
antennae. Unspooled when we scared it. Probably crying for help.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
won't get any, will it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
on this side of the ocean. It's probably just making a last call so
its owners'll know what happened. Sort of a suicide note.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco,
entangled a bit further back, twists around at that. &quot;Suicide?
You don't suppose these things self-destruct?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sudden
concern settles over the human kite. Alice Nakata tumbles into them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
we ought to let it go,&quot; Clarke says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
nods emphatically. &quot;It is not happy.&quot; Her disquiet radiates
through the others like a warning light.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
takes a few moments to disentangle themselves from the antennae. It
whips past and away, trailing a small float like a traffic cone.
Clarke tumbles, lets the water brake her. Machine roars recede into
grumbles, into mere tremors.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
rifters hang in empty midwater, silence on all sides.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
points a sonar pistol straight down, fires. &quot;Jeez. We're almost
thirty meters off the bottom.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
lose the squids?&quot; Brander says. &quot;That thing was really
moving.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
raises her pistol, takes a few more readings. &quot;Got 'em. They're
not all that far off, actually, I  hey.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There's
five of them. Closing fast.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ken?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well.
He's saving us a swim, anyway,&quot; Brander says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Did
anyone&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
turn. Alice Nakata starts again: &quot;Did anyone else feel it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Feel
what?&quot; Brander begins, but Clarke is nodding.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Judy?&quot;
Nakata says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
radiates reluctance. &quot;I  there was something, maybe.
Didn't get a good fix on it. I assumed it was one of you guys.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What,&quot;
Brander says. &quot;The muckraker? I thought&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
black cipher rises in their midst. His squid cruises straight up from
underneath like a slow missile. It hovers overhead when he releases
it. A couple of meters below, four other squids bob restlessly at
station-keeping, noses up.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
lost these,&quot; Lubin buzzes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thanks,&quot;
Brander replies.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
concentrates, tries to tune Lubin in. She's only going through the
motions, of course. He's dark to them. He's always been dark,
fine-tuning didn't change him a bit. Nobody knows why.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
what's going on?&quot; he asks. &quot;Your note said something about
a muckraker.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
got away from us,&quot; Caraco says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
was not happy,&quot; Nakata repeats.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Alice
got some sort of feeling off of it,&quot; Caraco says. &quot;Lenie

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Muckrakers

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
a man,&quot; Nakata says. &quot;Not a person. But&quot; She

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke lies on her bunk, alone again. Really alone. She can remember
a time, not so long ago, when she reveled in this kind of isolation.
Who would have thought that she'd miss <i>feelings</i>?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Even
if they are someone else's</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
yet it's true. Every time Beebe takes her in, some vital part of her
falls away like a half-remembered dream. The airlock clears, her body
reinflates, and her awareness turns flat and muddy. The others just
<i>vanish</i>. It's strange; she can see them, hear them the way she
always could. But if they don't move and she closes her eyes, she's
got no way of <i>knowing</i> they're here.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now
her only company is herself. Just one set of signals to process in
here. Nothing jamming her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Shit.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Blind,
or naked. That was the choice. It nearly killed her. <i>My own damn
fault, of course. I was just </i>asking <i>for it.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
was, too. She could have just left everything the way it was, quietly
deleted Acton's file before anyone else found out about it. But
there'd been this debt. Something owed to the ghost of the Thing
Outside, the thing that didn't snarl or blame or lash out, the thing
that, finally, took the Thing Inside away where it couldn't hurt her
any more. Part of Lenie Clarke still hates Acton for that, on some
sick level where conditioned reflex runs the show; but even down
there, she thinks maybe he did it for her. Like it or not, she owed
him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So
she paid up. She called the others inside and played the file. She
told them what he'd said, that last time, and she didn't ask them to
turn their backs on his offering even though she desperately hoped
they would. If she had asked, perhaps, they might have listened. But
one by one, they split themselves open and made the changes. Mike
Brander, out of curiosity. Judy Caraco, out of skepticism. Alice
Nakata, afraid of being left behind. Ken Lubin, unsuccessfully, for
reasons he kept to himself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
clenches her eyelids, remembers rules changing overnight. Careful
appearances suddenly meant nothing; blank eyes and ninja masks were
just cosmetic affectations, useless as armor. <i>How are you feeling,
Lenie Clarke? Horny, bored, upset?</i> <i>So easy to tell, though
your eyes are hidden behind those corneal opacities. You could be
terrified. You could be pissing in your 'skin and everyone would
know. </i></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Why
did you tell them? Why did you tell them? Why did you </i>tell <i>them?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Outside,
she watched the others change. They moved around her without
speaking, one connecting smoothly with another to lend a hand or a
piece of equipment. When she needed something from one of them, it
was there before she could speak. When they needed something from her
they had to ask aloud, and the choreography would falter. She felt
like the token cripple in a dance troupe. She wondered how much of
her they could see, and was afraid to ask.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Inside,
sometimes, she would try. It was safer there; the thread that
connected the rest of them fell apart in atmosphere, put everyone
back on equal terms. Brander spoke of a heightened awareness of the
presence of others; Caraco compared it to body language. &quot;Just
sort of makes up for the eyecaps,&quot; she said, apparently
expecting Clarke to feel reassured at that.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
it was Alice Nakata who finally remarked, almost offhandedly, that
other people's feelings could be... distracting...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke's been tuned for a while now. It's not so bad. No precise
telepathic insights, no sudden betrayals. It's more like the
sensation from a ghost limb, the ancestral memory of a tail you can
almost feel behind you. And Clarke knows now that Nakata was right.
Outside, the feelings of the others trickle into her, masking,
diluting. Sometimes she can even forget she has any of her own.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
something else, too, a familiar core in each of them, dark and
writhing and angry. That doesn't surprise her. They don't even talk
about it. Might as well discuss the fact that they all have five
fingers on each hand.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gels,&quot;
Clarke prompts.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Right.
Well, they've always needed neural nets in those things, you know,
they wander around some pretty hairy topography  you hear
about those two muckrakers that got caught up in the Aleutian Trench?
 anyway, navigation through complex environments generally
needs a net of some sort. Usually it's gallium-arsenide based, but
even those don't come close to matching a human brain for spatial
stuff. They still just <i>crawled</i> when it came to figuring
seamounts, that sort of thing. So they've started replacing them with
smart gels.&quot;</font></font></p>

actually, it wasn't really an emotion at all, it was just 

divergence. From what was expected.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He's
usually further out, isn't he?&quot; Clarke speaks softly, as if

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
don't know why they can't tune Lubin in. He says they're all dark to

brought the subject up since.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's

minimizes &quot;observer effects&quot;, but it may present problems
given that the rifters do not keep reliable schedules. This makes it
difficult to plan one's time with them, and in fact there's one

Scanlon lies on his bunk, not listening. He does not hear any strange

keening from the seabed, no faint sound of howling wind because he
knows that, down here, no wind is possible. Imagination, perhaps. A
trick of the brain stem, an auditory hallucination. He's not the

remembers the first time he heard the recording. Four lousy words:

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">We're
all mammals, of course. We therefore have a Circadian rhythm which
calibrates itself to ambient photoperiod. It's been known for some
time that when people are denied photoperiodic cues their rhythms
tend to lengthen, usually stabilizing between twenty-seven and
thirty-six hours. Adherence to a regular twenty-four hour work
schedule is usually sufficient to keep this from happening, so we
didn't expect a problem in the deep stations. As an added measure I
recommended that a normal photoperiod be built into Beebe's lighting
systems; the lights are programmed to dim slightly between twenty-two
hundred and oh seven hundred every day.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">The
participants have apparently chosen to ignore these cues. Even during
'daytime' they keep ambient lighting dimmer than my suggested
'nocturnal' levels. (They also prefer to leave their eyecaps in at
all times, for obvious reasons; although I had not predicted this
behavior, it is consistent with the profile.) Work schedules are
somewhat  flexible, but this is to be expected given that
their sleep cycles are always shifting in relation to each other.
Rifters do not wake up in time to perform their duties; they perform
their duties whenever two or more of them happen to be awake. I
suspect that they also work alone sometimes, a safety violation, but
I have yet to confirm this.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">For
the moment, these unorthodox behaviors do not appear to be serious.
Necessary work seems to get done on time, even though the station is
currently understaffed. However, I believe the situation is
potentially problematic. Efficiency could probably be improved by
stricter adherence to a twenty-four hour diel cycle. Should the GA
wish to ensure such adherence, I would recommend proteoglycan therapy
for the participants. Hypothalamic rewiring is another possibility;
it is more invasive, but would be virtually impossible to subvert. </font></font>

That's a good metaphor. They avoid the light, and they've taken out
all the mirrors. That could be part of the problem right there.
Scanlon had very sound reasons for recommending mirrors in the first

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Most
of Beebe all of it, except for his cubby is too dark
for uncapped vision. Maybe the vampires are trying to conserve
energy. A high priority, sitting here next to eleven thousand
megawatts' worth of generating equipment. Still, these people are all
under forty; they probably can't imagine a world without rationed
power.</font></font></p>

the past two days, leaving his cubby has been like creeping out into

don't seem to stop clenching until they're a micron away from
grinding his body to pulp. There's a stiffness in the joints. It's
perfectly safe, of course. Perfectly. And Scanlon can breathe
unpressurised air when he goes outside, and nobody's had to carve out
half his chest in the meantime.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He's
been out now for about fifteen minutes. Beebe's just a few meters
away. Clarke and Brander escort him on his maiden voyage, keeping
their distance. Scanlon kicks, rises clumsily from the bottom; the
mesh lets him swim like a man with splinted limbs. Vampires skim the
edge of his vision like effortless shadows.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
helmet seems like the center of the universe. Wherever he looks, an
infinite weight of black ocean presses in against the acrylic. A tiny
flaw down by the neck seal catches his eye; he stares, horrified, as
a hairline crack grows across his field of vision.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Help!

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
thumb grinds down on the crack in Scanlon's helmet. The crack smears,
<i>bursts</i>; fine gory filaments smudge against the acrylic. The
back half of the hairline peels off and writhes loose into the water,
coiling, uncoiling</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Dying.</i>
Scanlon pants with relief. <i>A worm. Some stupid fucking roundworm

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
looks around. Brander, hanging off his right shoulder, points to the
gory remnants sticking to the helmet. &quot;If it ever really cracked
you wouldn't have time to complain. You'd look just like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
clears his throat. &quot;Thanks. Sorry, I well, you know I'm

silent for a second. Then: &quot;You're lying.&quot; It doesn't sound

the vocoder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
do you say that?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't answer. Something else does; not quite a moan, not quite a

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
feels the abyss trickling down his back. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
pushes off the bottom at an angle, slides up through the water to

about to embark on my first extended dive. Apparently, the
participants have been asked to catch a fish for one of the Pharm

usually Pharms are only interested in bacteria, and they use their
own people for collecting but it provides the participants
with a change from the usual routine, and it provides me an
opportunity to watch them in action. I expect to learn a great deal.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
drops into the wet room and finds it empty. He struggles into his
armor single-handed, taking an extra few moments to ensure that the
helmet bubble is spotless. He catches up with Clarke and Caraco just
outside; Clarke is checking out a quartet of squids hovering over the
seabed. One of them is tethered to a specimen canister resting on the
bottom, a pressure-proof coffin over two meters long. Caraco sets it
for neutral buoyancy; it rises a few centimeters.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
set off without a word. The squids tow them into the abyss; the women
in the lead, Scanlon and the canister following behind. Scanlon looks
back over his shoulder. Beebe's comforting lights wash down from
yellow to gray, then disappear entirely. Feeling a sudden need for
reassurance, he trips through the channels on his acoustic modem.
There: the homing beacon. You're never really lost down here as long
as you can hear that.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
and Caraco are running dark. Not even their squids are shining.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Not
that they would anyway.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Occasional
dim lights flash briefly at the corner of his eye, but they always
vanish when he looks at them. After an endless few minutes a bright
smear fades into view directly ahead, resolves into a collection of
copper beacons and dark angular skyscrapers. The vampires avoid the
light, head around it at an angle. Scanlon and cargo follow
helplessly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
set up just off the Throat, at the borderline between light and dark.
Caraco unlatches the canister as Clarke rises into the column above
them; she's got something in her right hand, but Scanlon can't see
what it is. She holds it up as though displaying it to an invisible
crowd.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
gibbers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
sounds like a very loud mosquito at first. Then it dopplers down to a
low growl, slides back up into erratic high frequency.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
now, finally, Lenie Clarke turns her headlight on.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
hangs up there like some crucified ascendant, her hand whining at the
abyss, the light from her head sweeping the water like, like</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><i>a
dinner bell</i>, Scanlon realizes as something charges out of the
darkness at her, almost as big as she is and Jesus the <i>teeth</i>
on it</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
swallows her leg up to the crotch. Lenie Clarke takes it all in
stride. She jabs down with a billy that's magically appeared in her
left hand. The creature bloats and bursts in a couple of places;
clumps of bubbles erupt like silvery mushrooms through flesh, shudder
off into the sky. The creature thrashes, its gullet a monstrous
scabbard around Clarke's leg. The vampire reaches down and dismembers
it with her bare hands.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco,
still fiddling with the canister, looks up. &quot;Hey, Len. They
wanted it <i>intact</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Wrong
kind,&quot; Clarke buzzes. The water around her is full of torn flesh
and flashing scavengers. Clarke ignores them, turning slowly,
scanning the abyss.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco:
&quot;Behind you; four o'clock.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Got
it,&quot; Clarke says, spinning to a new bearing. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nothing
happens. The shredded carcass, still twitching, drifts toward the
bottom, scavengers sparkling on all sides. Clarke's hand-held
voicebox gurgles and whines.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>How</i>
Scanlon moves his tongue in his mouth, ready to ask aloud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
now,&quot; Caraco buzzes at him, before he can.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>There's
nothing there. What are they keying on?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
comes in fast, unswerving, from the precise direction Lenie Clarke is
facing. &quot;That'll do,&quot; she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
muffled explosion to Scanlon's left. A thin contrail of bubbles
streaks from Caraco to monster, connecting the two in an instant. The
thing jerks at a sudden impact. Clarke slips to one side as it
thrashes past, Caraco's dart embedded in its flank.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke's
headlight goes out, her voicebox falls silent. Caraco stows the dart
gun and swims up to join her. The two women maneuver their quarry
down towards the canister. It snaps at them, weak and spastic. They
push it down into the coffin, seal the top.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Like
shooting fish for a barrel,&quot; Caraco buzzes.</font></font></p>

did you know it was coming?&quot; Scanlon asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
always come,&quot; Caraco says. &quot;The sound fools them. And the
light.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
mean, how did you know which direction? In advance?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
moment's silence.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
just get a feel for it after a while,&quot; Clarke says finally.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That,&quot;
Caraco adds, &quot;and this.&quot; She holds up a sonar pistol, tucks
it back under her belt.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
convoy reforms. There's a prescribed drop-off point for monsters, a
hundred meters away from the Throat. (The GA has never been keen on
letting outsiders wander too far into its home turf.) Once again the
vampires leave light for darkness, Scanlon in tow. They travel
through a world utterly without form, save for the scrolling circle
of mud in his headlight. Suddenly Clarke turns to Caraco.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'll
go,&quot; she buzzes, and peels away into the void.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
throttles his squid, edges up beside Caraco.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Here
we are,&quot; Caraco says. They coast to a halt. Caraco fins back to
the droned squid and touches a control; buckles disengage, straps
retract. The canister floats free. Caraco cranks down the buoyancy
and it settles down on a clump of tubeworms.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Len
uh, Clarke,&quot; Scanlon prods.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
need an extra hand back at the Throat. She went to help out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
checks his modem channel. Of course it's the right one, if it wasn't
he wouldn't be able to hear Caraco. Which means that Clarke and the
vampires at the Throat must have been using a different frequency.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
he's not a fool, he knows the story. They've only switched channels

accompanied Judy Caraco and Lenie Clarke outside today, and witnessed
several events that concern me. Both participants swam through unlit
areas without headlamps and spent significant periods of time
isolated from dive buddies; at one point, Caraco simply left me on
the seabed without warning. This is potentially life-threatening
behavior, although of course I was able to find my way back to Beebe
using the homing beacon.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I
have yet to receive an explanation for all this. The v the
other personnel are presently gone from the station. I can find two
or three of them on sonar; I suppose the rest are just hidden in the
bottom clutter. Once again, this is extremely unsafe behavior.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Such
recklessness appears to be typical here. It implies a relative
indifference to personal welfare, an attitude entirely consistent
with the profile I developed at the onset of the rifter program. (The
only alternative is that they simply do not appreciate the dangers
involved in this environment, which is unlikely.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">It
is also consistent with a generalized post-traumatic addiction to
hostile environments. This doesn't constitute evidence <i>per sé</i>,
of course, but I have noted one or two other things which, taken
together, may be cause for concern. Michael Brander, for example, has
a history which ranges from caffeine and sympathomimetic abuse to
limbic hot-wiring. He's known to have brought a substantial supply of
phencyclidine derms with him to Beebe; I've just located it in his
cubby and I was surprised to find that it has barely been touched.
Phencyclidine is not, physiologically speaking, addictive
exogenous-drug addicts are screened out of the program but the
fact remains that Brander had a habit when he came down here, a habit
which he has since abandoned. I have to wonder what he's replaced it
with.</font></font></p>

asked each of the participants to submit to a routine sweep under the
medical scanner or rather, I've asked most of them directly,
and asked them to pass the word on to Ken Lubin, whom I've seen a few
times now but haven't actually spoken to yet. (I have twice attempted
to engage Mr. Lubin in conversation, without success.) The
participants know, of course, that medical scans do not require
physical contact on my part, and they're well able to run them at
their own convenience without me even being present. Still, although
no one has explicitly refused my request, there has been a notable
lack of enthusiasm in terms of actual compliance. It's fairly obvious
(and entirely consistent with my profile) that they consider it
something of an intrusion, and will avoid it if possible. To date
I've managed to get rundowns on only Alice Nakata and Judy Caraco.
I've appended their binaries to this entry; both show elevated
production of dopamine and norepinephrine, but I can't establish
whether this began before or after their present tour of duty. GABA
and other inhibitor levels were slightly up, too, left over from
their previous dive (less than an hour before the scan). </font></font>

others, so far, haven't been able to &quot;find the time&quot; for an
exam. In the meantime I've resorted to going over stored scanner
records of old injuries. Not surprisingly, physical injuries are
common down here, although they've become much less frequent as of
late. There are no cases of head trauma on record, however at
least, nothing that would warrant an NMR. This effectively limits my
brain chemistry data to what the participants are willing to provide
on request not much, so far. If this doesn't change, the bulk
of my analysis will have to be based on behavioral observations. As
medieval as that sounds.</font></font></p>

Yves Scanlon first sank into the abyss he had two questions on his

footsteps, or low voices, or just maybe the distant cry

scroll up, link files, search for keywords. Personnel records dance

and her cronies are such assholes. They've been lying to him from the
start. Scanlon doesn't know why. He'd have been okay with it, if
they'd just leveled with him. But they kept it under wraps. As though
he wouldn't be able to figure it out for himself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
bloody obvious. There's more than one way to make a vampire. Usually
you take someone who's fucked in the head, and you train them. But
why couldn't you take someone who's already trained, and then fuck
them in the head? It might even be cheaper.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">You
can learn a lot from a witch hunt. All that repressed-memory hysteria
back in the nineties, for example: so many people suddenly
remembering abuse, or alien abduction, or dear old grandma stirring a
cauldron of stewed babies. It didn't take much, no one had to go in
and physically rewire the synapses; the brain's gullible enough to
rewire <i>itself</i> if you coax it. Most of those poor bozos didn't
even know they were doing it. These days it only takes a few weeks
worth of hypnotherapy. The right suggestions, delivered just the
right way, can inspire memories to build themselves out of bits and
pieces. Sort of a neurological cascade effect. And once you <i>think</i>
you've been abused, well, why wouldn't your psyche shift to match?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
a good idea. Someone else thought so too, at least that's what
Scanlon heard from Mezzich a couple of weeks ago. Nothing official,
of course, but there may already be a few prototypes in the system.
Someone right here in Beebe, maybe, a walking testament to Induced
False Memory Syndrome. Maybe Lubin. Maybe Clarke. Could be anyone,
really.</font></font></p>

told him, all right. They told him, when he first started, that he
was coming in on the ground floor. <i>You'll have input on pretty
much everything</i>, was what Rowan had promised. <i>The design work,
the follow-ups</i>. They even offered him automatic coauthorship on
all unclassified publications. Yves Scanlon was supposed to be a

mumbling to recruits while <i>they</i> made all the decisions up on

He wonders who it might be. Brander or Nakata, maybe. Her record
shows a background in geothermal engineering and high-pressure tech,

really. Just can't seem to sleep.&quot; Scanlon dons a disarming
smile. &quot;Just not used to the pressure, I guess.&quot; <i>That's
right. Put her at ease. Acknowledge her superiority.</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
just stares at him</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know how you take it, month after month,&quot; he adds.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes
you do. You're a psychiatrist. You <i>chose</i> us.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
I'm more of a mechanic.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Of
course,&quot; she says, expressionless. &quot;It's your job to keep
things broken.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
looks away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
stands up and takes a step towards the hatchway, her tending duties
apparently forgotten. Scanlon stands aside. She brushes past, somehow
avoiding physical contact in the cramped space.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Look,&quot;
he blurts out, &quot;how about a quick review of the tending
procedure? I'm not all that familiar with this equipment.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
too obvious. He knows she sees through it before the words are even
out of his mouth. But it's also a perfectly reasonable request from
someone in his role. Routine evaluation, after all.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
watches him for a moment, her head cocked a bit to one side. Her
face, expressionless as usual, somehow conveys the impression of a
slight smile. Finally she sits down again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
taps on a menu. &quot;This is the Throat.&quot; A cluster of luminous
rectangles nested in a background of contour lines. &quot;Thermal
readout.&quot; The image erupts into psychedelic false color, red and
yellow hot spots pulsing at irregular intervals along the main
fissure. &quot;You don't usually bother with thermal when you're
tending,&quot; Clarke explains. &quot;When you're out there you find
that stuff out sooner first-hand anyway.&quot; The psychedelia fades
back to green and gray.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>And
what happens if someone gets taken by surprise out there and you
don't have the readings in here to know they're in trouble?</i>
Scanlon doesn't ask aloud. Just another cut corner.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
pans, finds a pair of alphanumeric icons. &quot;Alice and Ken.&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,&quot;
Scanlon says, &quot;that's a <i>deadman switch</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>No
audio alarm. Why isn't there an alarm</i> His eyes dart across
the half-familiar console. <i>Where is it, whereshit</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
alarm's been disabled.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Look!</i>&quot;
Scanlon points at the display. &quot;Can't you&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks up at him, almost lazily. She doesn't seem to understand.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
jabs his thumb down. &quot;Somebody just <i>died</i> out there!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks at the screen, slowly shakes her head. &quot;No&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>You
stupid bitch, you cut off the alarm!</i>&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
hits a control icon. The station starts howling. Scanlon jumps back,
startled, bumps the bulkhead. Clarke watches him, frowning slightly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>What's
wrong with you?</i>&quot; He reaches out and grabs her by the
shoulders. &quot;<i>Do something!</i> Call Lubin, call&quot;
The alarm is deafening. He shakes her, hard, pulls her up out of the
chair </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
remembers, too late: <i>you don't touch Lenie Clarke.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
happens in her face. It almost <i>crumples</i>, right there in front
of him. Lenie Clarke the ice queen is suddenly nowhere to be seen. In
her place there's only a beaten, blind little kid, body shaking,
mouth moving in the same pattern over and over, he can't hear over
the alarm but her lips shape the words, <i>I'm sorry I'm sorry</i>
<i>I'm sorry</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">All
in the few scant seconds before she crystallizes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
seems to harden against the sound, against Scanlon's assault. Her
face goes completely blank. She rises out of the chair, centimeters
taller than she should be. One hand comes up, grabs Yves Scanlon by
the throat. Pushes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
staggers backwards into the lounge, flailing. The table appears to
one side; he reaches out, steadies himself. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Suddenly,
Beebe falls silent again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
takes a deep breath. Another vampire has appeared in his peripheral
vision, standing impassively at the mouth of the corridor; he ignores
it. Directly ahead, Lenie Clarke is sitting down again in
Communications, her back turned. Scanlon steps forward.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
Karl,&quot; she says before he can speak.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
takes a moment to register: <i>Acton</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
that was months ago,&quot; Scanlon says. &quot;You <i>lost</i> him.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
lost him.&quot; She breathes, slowly. &quot;He went down a smoker. It
erupted.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry,&quot; Scanlon says. &quot;I didn't know.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.&quot;
Her voice is tight with controlled indifference. &quot;He's too far
down to we can't get him back. Too dangerous.&quot; She turns
to face him, impossibly calm. &quot;Deadman switch still works,
though. It'll keep screaming until the battery runs down.&quot; She
shrugs. &quot;So we keep the alarm off.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't blame you,&quot; Scanlon says softly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Imagine,&quot;
Clarke tells him, &quot;how much your approval comforts me.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
turns to leave.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Wait,&quot;
she says. &quot;I can zoom in for you. I can show you exactly where
he died, maximum res.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
not necessary.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
stabs controls. &quot;No problem. Naturally you're interested. What
kind of mechanic wouldn't want to know the performance specs on his
own creation?&quot; She reshapes the display like a sculptor, hones
it down and down until there's nothing left but a tangle of faint
green lines and a red pulsing dot.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
got wedged into an ancillary crevice,&quot; she says. &quot;Looks
like a tight fit even now, when all the flesh has been boiled away.
Don't know how he managed to get down there when he was all in one
piece.&quot; There's no stress in her voice at all. She could be
talking about a friend's vacation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
can feel her eyes on him; he keeps his on the screen.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fischer,&quot;
he says. &quot;What happened to him?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From
the corner of his eye: she starts to tense, turns it into a shrug.
&quot;Who knows? Maybe Archie got him.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Archie?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Archie
Toothis.&quot; Scanlon doesn't recognize the name; it's not in any of
his files, as far as he knows. He considers, decides not to push it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Did
<i>Fischer's</i> deadman go off, at least?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
didn't have one.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;The abyss can kill you any
number of ways, Scanlon. It doesn't always leave traces.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
I'm sorry if I upset you, Lenie.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
corner of her mouth barely twitches.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
he <i>is</i> sorry. Even though it's not his fault. <i>I didn't make
you what you are</i>, he wants to say. <i>I didn't smash you into
junk, that was someone else. I just came along afterwards and found a
use for you. I gave you a purpose, more of a purpose than you ever
had back </i>there<i>.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Is

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
doesn't dare ask aloud, so he turns to leave. And when Lenie Clarke
lays one finger, very briefly, on the screen where Acton's icon
flashes, he pretends not to notice.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I
recently had an interesting conversation with Lenie Clarke. Although
she didn't admit so openly she is very well defended, and
quite expert at hiding her feelings from laypeople I believe
that she and Karl Acton were sexually involved. This is a heartening
discovery, insofar as my original profiles strongly suggested that
such a relationship would develop. (Clarke has a history of
relationships with Intermittent Explosives.) This adds a measure of
empirical confidence to other, related predictions regarding rifter
behavior.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I
have also learned that Karl Acton, rather than simply disappearing,
was actually killed by an erupting smoker. I don't know what he was
doing down there I'll continue to investigate but the
behavior itself seems foolish at best and quite possibly suicidal.
Suicide is not consistent either with Karl Acton's DSM or ECM
profiles, which must have been accurate when first derived. Suicide,
therefore, would imply a degree of basic personality change. This is
consistent with the trauma-addiction scenario. However, some sort of
physical brain injury can not be ruled out. My search of the medical
logs didn't turn up any head injuries, but was limited to living
participants. Perhaps Acton was... different...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Oh.
I found out who Archie Toothis is. Not in the personnel files at all.
The library. <i>Architeuthis</i>: giant squid.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
hasn't, of course. Joel Kita caught a hint of ambient blue out the
dorsal port just ten minutes ago. Right before they dropped through
the deep scattering layer; pretty thin stuff compared to the old
days, he's been told, but still impressive. Glowing siphonophores and
flashlight fish and all. Still beautiful.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That's
a thousand meters above them now. Right here there's nothing but the
thin vertical slash of Beebe's transponder line. Joel has put the
'scaphe into a lazy spin during the drop, forward floods sweeping the
water in a descending corkscrew. The transponder line swings past the
main viewport every thirty seconds or so, keeping time, a bright
vertical line against the dark.</font></font></p>

tiny monster bumps the port. Needle teeth so long the mouth can't
close, an eel-like body studded with glowing photophores
fifteen, twenty centimeters long, tops. It's not even big enough to
make a sound when it hits and then it's gone, spinning away above
them.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,

checks tactical, nudges a trim tab.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Now
viperfish, they're not supposed to get any bigger than the one you
just saw,&quot; Jarvis remarks. &quot;But there was a guy, oh, back
in the 1930s Beebe his name was, the same guy they named
anyway, he swore he saw one that was over two meters long.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
grunts. &quot;Didn't know people came down here back then.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,
well, they were just starting out. And everyone had always thought
deepwater fish were these puny little midgets, because that's all
they ever brought up in their trawls. But then Beebe sees this big
ripping viperfish, and people start thinking hey, maybe we only
caught little ones because all the big ones could outswim the trawls.
Maybe the deep sea really <i>is</i> teeming with giant monsters.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
not,&quot; Joel says. &quot;At least, not that I've seen.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,
well, that's what most people think. Every now and then you get
pieces of something weird washing up, though. And of course there's
Megamouth. And your garden-variety giant squid.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
never get down this far. I bet none of your other giants do either.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
we're not sure. We're working on it, though. That's what I'm doing

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
it's already been bagged. The rifters got it for us a couple of days

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Got

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh,&quot;
Jarvis says. &quot;That's just to sterilize the sample.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot; Joel lets his eyes run over the panels. &quot;You must
pull a lot of weight back on shore.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh?
Why's that?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
used to make the Channer run a lot. Pharmaceutical dives, supply
trips to Beebe, ecotourism. A while back I shuttled some corpse type
out to Beebe; he said he was staying for a month or so. The GA calls
me three days later and tells me to go pick him up. I show up for the
run and they tell me it's cancelled. No explanation.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Pretty
strange,&quot; Jarvis remarks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're the
first run I've had to Channer in six weeks. You're the first run
<i>anyone</i>'s had, from what I can tell. So, you pull some weight.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
really.&quot; Jarvis shrugs in the half-light. &quot;I'm just a
research associate. I go where they tell me, just like you. Today
they told me to go and pick up an order of fish to go.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
looks at him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
were asking why they got so big,&quot; Jarvis says, deking to the
right. &quot;We figure it's some kind of endosymbiotic infection.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No
shit.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Say
it's easier for some microbe to live inside a fish than out in the
ocean  less osmotic stress  so once inside it's pumping
out more ATP than it needs.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;ATP,&quot;
Joel says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;High-energy
phosphate compound. Cellular battery. Anyway, it spits out this
surplus ATP, and the host fish can use it as extra growth energy. So
maybe Channer Vent's got some sort of unique bug that infects teleost
fishes and gives 'em a growth spurt.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Pretty
weird.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
happens all the time. Every one of your own cells is a colony, for
that matter. You know, nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts if you're
a plant&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not.&quot; <i>More than I can say for some folks...</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;those
all used to be free-living microbes in their own right. A few billion
years ago something ate them, but it couldn't digest them properly so
they all just kept living inside the cytoplasm. Eventually they
struck up a deal with the host cell, took over housecleaning tasks
and suchlike in lieu of rent. Voila: your modern eukaryotic cell.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So what
happens if this Channer bug gets into a person? We all grow three
meters high?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
polite laugh. &quot;Nope. People stop growing when they reach
adulthood. So do most vertebrates, actually. Fish, on the other hand,
keep growing their whole lives. And <i>deepwater</i> fishthose
don't do anything <i>except</i> grow, if you know what I mean.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
raises his eyebrows.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Jarvis holds up his
hands. &quot;I know, I know. Your baby finger is bigger than your
average deepsea fish. But that just means they're short of fuel; when
they <i>do </i>gas up, believe me, they use it for growth. Why waste
calories just swimming around when you can't see anything anyway? In
dark environments it makes more sense for predators to sit-and-wait.
Whereas if you grow big enough, maybe you'll get too big for <i>other</i>
predators, you see?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Mmm.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Of
course, we're basing the whole theory on a couple of samples that got
dragged up without any protection against temperature or pressure
changes.&quot; Jarvis snorts. &quot;Might as well have sent them in a
paper bag. But this time we're doing it right hey, is that
<i>light</i> I see down there?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a vague yellow glow smudging the darkness directly below. Joel calls
up a topographic display: Beebe. The geothermal array over at the
rift proper lays out a sequence of hard green echoes bearing 340°.
And just to the left of that, about a hundred meters off the
east-most generator, something squirts a unique acoustic signature at
four-second intervals.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
taps commands to the dive planes. The 'scaphe pulls out of its spiral
and coasts off to the northeast. Beebe Station, never more than a
bright stain, fades to stern.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
ocean floor resolves suddenly in the 'scaphe's headlights; bone-gray
ooze slides past, occasional outcroppings, great squashed
marshmallows of lava and pumice. In the cockpit a flashing point of
light slo-mo's towards the center of the topographic display.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
charges them from overhead; the dull wet sound of its impact
reverberates briefly through the hull. Joel looks up through the
dorsal port but sees nothing. Several more impacts, staggered. The
'scaphe whirs implacably onward.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
looks almost like a lifeboat canister, three meters long. Readouts
twinkle from a panel on one rounded end. It's resting on a carpet of
giant tubeworms, their feathery crowns extended in full
filter-feeding mode. Joel thinks of the baby Moses, nestled in a
clump of mutant bulrushes. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Wait
a second,&quot; Jarvis says. &quot;Kill the lights first.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
for?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't need them, do you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
no. I can use instruments if I have to. But why&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Just
do it, okay?&quot; Jarvis, the chatterbox, is suddenly all business.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Darkness
floods the cockpit, retreats a bit before the glow of the readouts.
Joel grabs a pair of eyephones off a hook to his left. The sea floor
reappears before him courtesy of the ventral photoamps, faded to blue
and black.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
coaxes the 'scaphe into position directly above the canister, listens
to the clank and creak of grapples flexing beneath the deck; metal
claws the color of slate extend across his field of view.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Spray
it before you pick it up,&quot; Jarvis says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
reaches out and taps the control codes without looking. The 'phones
show him a nozzle extending from Jarvis's tank, taking aim like a
skinny cobra.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Do
it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
nozzle ejaculates gray-blue murk, sprays back and forth along the
length of the canister, sweeping the benthos on either side. The
tubeworms yank back into their tunnels and shut the doors; the whole
featherduster forest vanishes in an instant, leaving a crowd of
sealed leathery tubes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
nozzle spews its venom.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
of the tubes opens, almost hesitantly. Something dark and stringy
drifts out, twitching. The gray plume sweeps across it; it sags,
lifeless, across the sill of its burrow. Other tubes are opening now.
Invertebrate corpses slump back into sight.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
in this stuff?&quot; Joel whispers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Cyanide.
Rotenone. Some other things. Sort of a cocktail.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
nozzle sputters for a few seconds and runs dry. Automatically, Joel
retracts it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,&quot;
Jarvis says. &quot;Let's grab it and go home.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
doesn't move.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,&quot;
Jarvis says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
shakes his head, plays the machinery. The 'scaphe extends its arms in
a metal hug, pulls the canister off the bottom. Joel strips the
'phones from his eyes and taps the controls. They begin rising. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
was a pretty thorough rinse,&quot; Joel remarks after a while.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.
Well, the sample's costing us a fair bit. Don't want to contaminate
it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
can turn the lights back on,&quot; Jarvis says. &quot;How long before
we break the surface?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
trips the floods. &quot;Twenty minutes. Half hour.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
hope the lifter pilot doesn't get too bored.&quot; Jarvis is all
chummy again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There
is no pilot. It's a smart gel.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Really?
You don't say.&quot; Jarvis frowns. &quot;Those are scary things,
those gels. You know one suffocated a bunch of people in London a
while back?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Yes</i>,
Joel's about to say, but Jarvis is back in spew mode. &quot;No shit.
It was running the subway system over there, perfect operational
record, and then one day it just forgets to crank up the ventilators
when it's supposed to. Train slides into station fifteen meters
underground, everybody gets out, no air, boom.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel's
heard this before. The punchline's got something to do with a broken
clock, if he remembers it right. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;These
things teach themselves from experience, right?,&quot; Jarvis
continues. &quot;So everyone just assumed it had learned to cue the
ventilators on something obvious. Body heat, motion, CO<font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><sub>2</sub></font>
levels, you know. Turns out instead it was watching a clock on the
wall. Train arrival correlated with a predictable subset of patterns
on the digital display, so it started the fans whenever it saw one of
those patterns.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah.
That's right.&quot; Joel shakes his head. &quot;And vandals had
smashed the clock, or something.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey.
You <i>did</i> hear about it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Jarvis,
that story's ten years old if it's a day. That was way back when they
were starting out with these things. Those gels have been debugged
from the molecules up since then.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah?
What makes you so sure?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Because
a gel's been running the lifter for the better part of a year now,
and it's had plenty of opportunity to fuck up. It hasn't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
you like these things?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fuck
no,&quot; Joel says, thinking about Ray Stericker. Thinking about
himself. &quot;I'd like 'em a lot better if they <i>did</i> screw up
sometimes, you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
I don't like 'em <i>or </i>trust 'em. You've got to wonder what
they're up to.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
nods, distracted by Jarvis' digression. But then his mind returns to
dead tube worms, and undeclared no-dive zones, and an anonymous
canister drenched with enough poison to kill a fucking city.</font></font></p>

<font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">There's
no doubt that the ability to function down here stems from attributes
which would, under other conditions, qualify as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;.
These attributes not only permit long-term exposure to the rift; they
may also intensify as a <i>result</i> of that exposure. Lenie Clarke,
for example, has developed a mutilation neurosis which she could not
have had prior to her arrival here. Her fascination with an animal
which can be easily &quot;fixed&quot; when broken has fairly obvious
roots, notwithstanding a number of horribly botched attempts at
&quot;repair&quot;. Judith Caraco, who used to run indoor marathons
prior to her arrest, compulsively swims up and down Beebe's
transponder line. The other participants have probably developed
corresponding habits.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">Whether
these behaviors are indicative of a physiological addiction I can not
yet say. If they are, I suspect that Kenneth Lubin may be the
furthest along. During conversation with some of the other
participants I have learned that Lubin may actually <i>sleep</i>
outside on occasion, which can not be considered healthy by anyone's
standards. I would be better able to understand the reason for this
if I had more particulars about Lubin's background. Of course, his
file as provided is missing certain relevant details.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">On
the job, the participants work unexpectedly well together, given the
psychological baggage each of them carries. Duty shifts carry an
almost uncanny sense of coordination. They seem choreographed. It's
almost as if</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt">This
is a subjective impression, of course, but I believe that rifters do
in fact share some heightened awareness of each other, at least when
they're outside. They may also have a heightened awareness of <i>me</i>
either that, or they've made some remarkably shrewd guesses about my
state of mind. </font></font>

Too, too</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Too
easy to misinterpret. If the haploids back on shore read that, they
might think the vampires have the upper hand. Scanlon deletes the
last few lines, considers alternatives.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a word for his suspicions. It's a word that describes your experience
in an isolation tank, or in VR with all the inputs blanked, or
in extreme cases when someone cuts the sensory cables of your
central nervous system. It describes that state of sensory
deprivation in which whole sections of the brain go dark for want of
input. The word is Ganzfeld.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
very quiet in a Ganzfeld. Usually the temporal and occipital lobes
seethe with input, signals strong enough to swamp any competition.
When those fall silent, though, the mind can sometimes make out faint
whispers in the darkness. It imagines scenes that have a curious
likeness to those glowing on a television in some distant room,
perhaps. Or it feels a faint emotional echo, familiar but not,
somehow, first-hand.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Statistics
suggest that these sensations are not entirely imaginary. Experts of
an earlier decade people much like Yves Scanlon, except for
their luck in being in the right place at the right time have
even found out where the whispers come from. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
turns out that protein microtubules, permeating each and every
neuron, act as receivers for certain weak signals at the quantum
level. It turns out that consciousness itself is a quantum
phenomenon. It turns out that under certain conditions conscious
systems can interact directly, bypassing the usual sensory middlemen.

consistent given their larger corpus callosa and consequent advantage
in intercortical processing speed..</font></font></p>

Scanlon sits at the table and forces himself to eat with a mouth gone

out of his way to be completely nonthreatening. Unless they took

made so much sense at the time, though. Scanlon <i>knows</i> Lubins

simplicity, guaranteed to stay on-line through any systems crash

he? The moment he calls home hes admitting he cant do
the job by himself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now

female. The two of them hang in the water a few meters apart, facing
each other. Every now and then the female gestures with her hands;
sometimes she moves too suddenly and the other one jumps a little, as
if startled.</font></font></p>

clicks through the voice channels. Nothing. After a while the female
reaches out, almost tentatively, and touches the reptile. Theres
something almost gentle in an alien way about the way
she does that. Then she turns and swims off into the darkness. The
reptile stays behind, drifting slowly on its axis. Its face comes
into view.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Its
hood seal is open. Its face is so pale that Scanlon can barely tell

thing under its arm is the shredded remains of one of Channers

lunges. Another split-second and he wouldnt even have come

from his belt.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
hangs on. The reptile comes at him with both fists, utterly silent.
Scanlon barely feels the blows through his preshmesh. He hits back

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
is waiting there, standing motionless beside the ladder. He stares
through Scanlon with eyes of solid ivory.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
wanted to say goodbye,&quot; he says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
laughs. He can't help it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
watches impassively.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry,&quot; Scanlon says. He doesn't feel even slightly amused.
&quot;It's just you never even said <i>hello</i>, you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,&quot;
Lubin says. &quot;Well.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somehow,
there's no sense of threat about him this time. Scanlon can't quite
understand why; Lubin's background file is still full of holes, the
rumors are still festering over Galápagos; even the other
vampires keep their distance from this one. But none of that shows
through right now. Lubin just stands there, shifting his weight from
one foot to the other. He looks almost vulnerable.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
they're going to be bringing us back early,&quot; he says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
honestly don't know. It's not my decision.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
they sent you down to prepare the way. Like John the Baptist.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
a very strange analogy, coming from Lubin. Scanlon says nothing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Did
you didn't they <i>know</i> we wouldn't want to come back?
Didn't they count on it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
wasn't like that.&quot; But he wonders, more than ever, what the GA
knew.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
clears his throat. He seems very much to want to say something, but
doesn't.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
found the windchimes,&quot; Scanlon says at last.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
scared the hell out of me.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
shakes his head. &quot;That's not what they were for.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
<i>were</i> they for?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Just
a hobby, really. We've all got hobbies here. Lenie does her starfish.
Alice dreams. This place has a way of taking ugly things and
lighting them in a certain way, so they almost look beautiful.&quot;
A shrug. &quot;I build memorials.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Memorials.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
nods. &quot;The windchimes were for Acton.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
drops onto Beebe with a clank. Scanlon jumps.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
doesn't react. &quot;I'm thinking of building another set,&quot; he
says. &quot;For Fischer, maybe.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Memorials
are for dead people. Fischer's still alive.&quot; <i>Technically,
anyway.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay
then. I'll make them for you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
overhead hatch drops open. Scanlon grips his suitcase and starts to
climb, one-handed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sir&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
looks down, surprised.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I&quot;
Lubin stops himself. &quot;We could have treated you better,&quot; he
says at last. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
knows, somehow, that this is not what Lubin intended to say. He
waits. But Lubin offers nothing more.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thanks,&quot;
Scanlon says, and climbs out of Beebe forever. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
chamber he rises into is wrong. He looks around, disoriented; this
isn't the usual shuttle. The passenger compartment is too small, the
walls studded with an array of nozzles. Forward, the cockpit hatch is
sealed. A strange face looks back through the porthole as the ventral
hatch swings shut.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
face disappears. The compartment resonates with the sound of metal
mouths disengaging. A slight lurch and the 'scaphe is rising free.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
fine aerosol mist hisses from the nozzles. It stings Scanlon's eyes.
An unfamiliar voice reassures him from the cabin speaker. Nothing to
worry about, it says. Just a routine precaution.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Everything's
just fine.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
others don't seem to care. She hears Lubin and Caraco talking up in
the lounge, hears Brander trying to sing in the shower <i>as
if we didn't all get enough abuse during our </i>childhoods
and envies their unconcern. Everyone hated Scanlon well, not
<i>hate</i>, exactly, that's a bit strong but there was at
least a sort of</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Contempt</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That's
the word. Contempt. Back on the surface, Scanlon ticked everyone. No
matter what you said to him he'd nod, make little encouraging noises,
do everything to convince you that he was on your side. Except
actually agree with you, of course. You didn't need fine-tuning to
see through that shit; everyone down here already had too many
Scanlons in their past, the official sympathizers, the instant
friends who gently encouraged you to go back home, drop the charges,
carefully pretending it was <i>your</i> interests being served. Back
then Scanlon was just another patronizing bastard with a shaved deck,
and if fortune put him down here on rifter turf for a while, who
could be blamed for having a little fun with him?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>But
we could have killed him.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>He
started it. He attacked Gerry. He was holding him </i>hostage.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>As
if the GA's going to make any sort of allowance for </i>that...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So
far, Clarke's kept her doubts to herself. It's not that she fears no
one will listen to her. She fears the exact opposite. She doesn't
<i>want</i> to change anybody's mind. She's not out to rally the
troops. Initiative is a prerogative of leaders; she doesn't want the
responsibility. The last thing she wants to be is</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Leader
of the pack, Len. Head wolf. A-fucking-kayla.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Acton's
been dead for months and he's still laughing at her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Okay.
Scanlon was a nuisance at worst. At best he was an amusing diversion.
&quot;Shit,&quot; Brander said once, &quot;You tune him in out there?
I bet the <i>GA</i> doesn't even take him seriously.&quot; The Grid
needs them, and it's not going to pull the plug just because a few
rifters had some fun with an asshole like Scanlon. Makes sense.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Still,
Clarke can't help thinking about consequences. She's never been able
to avoid them in the past.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander's
finally out of the shower; his voice drifts down from the lounge.
Showers are an indulgence down here, hardly necessary when you live
inside a self-flushing semipermeable diveskin but a sheer hot
hedonistic pleasure just the same. Clarke grabs a towel off the rack
and heads up the ladder before anyone else can cut in.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,
Len.&quot; Caraco, seated at the table with Brander, waves her over.
&quot;Check out the new look.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander's
in real shirtsleeves. He doesn't even have his caps in. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
eyes are brown.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Wow.&quot;
Clarke doesn't know what else to say. Those eyes look really strange.
She looks around, vaguely uncomfortable. Lubin's over on the sofa,
watching. &quot;What do you think, Ken?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
shakes his head. &quot;Why do you want to look like a dryback?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
shrugs. &quot;Don't know. I just felt like giving my eyes a rest for
a couple of hours. I guess seeing Scanlon down here in shirtsleeves
all the time.&quot; Not that anyone would even <i>think</i> of
popping their caps in front of Scanlon. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
affects an exaggerated shudder. &quot;Please. Tell me he's not your
new role model.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
wasn't even my old one,&quot; Brander says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
can't get used to it. &quot;Doesn't it bother you?&quot; <i>Walking
around naked like that?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
the only thing that bothers me is I can't see squat. Unless someone
wants to turn up the lights...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
anyway.&quot; Caraco picks up the thread of some previous
conversation. &quot;You came down here why?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
safe,&quot; Brander says, blinking against his own personal darkness.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Saf<i>er</i>,
anyway. You were up there not so long ago. Didn't you see it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think what I saw up there was sort of skewed. That's why I'm down
here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
never thought that things were getting, well, top-heavy?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
shrugs. Clarke, imagining steamy needles of water, takes a step
towards the corridor.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
mean, look how fast the net changed,&quot; Brander says. &quot;It
wasn't that long ago you could just sit in your living room and go
all over the world, remember? Anywhere could link up with anywhere
else, for as long as they liked.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
turns back. She remembers those days. Vaguely.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
about the bugs?&quot; she asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There
weren't any. Or there were, but they were really simple. Couldn't
rewrite themselves, couldn't handle different operating systems. Just
a minor inconvenience at first, really.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
there were these laws they taught us in school,&quot; Caraco says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
remembers: &quot;Explosive speciation. Brookes' Laws.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
holds up a finger. &quot;<i>Self-replicating information strings
evolve as a sigmoid-difference function of replication error rate and
generation time.</i>&quot; Two fingers. &quot;<i>Evolving information
strings are vulnerable to parasitism by competing strings with
sigmoid-difference functions of lesser wavelength</i>.&quot; Three.
&quot;<i>Strings under pressure from parasites develop random
substring-exchange protocols as a function of the wavelength ratio of
the host and parasite sigmoid functions</i>. Or something like that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
looks at Clarke, then back at Brander. &quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Life
evolves. Parasites evolve. Sex evolves to counter the parasites.
Shuffles the genes so they have to shoot for a moving target.
Everything else species diversity, density-dependence,
everything it all follows from those three laws. You get a
self-replicating string past a certain threshold, it's like a nuclear
reaction.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Life
explodes,&quot; Clarke murmurs.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually,
<i>information</i> explodes. Organic life's just a really slow
example. Happened a lot faster in the net.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
shakes her head. &quot;So what? You're saying you came down here to
get away from bugs in the Internet?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
came down here to get away from <i>entropy.</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think,&quot; Clarke remarks, &quot;You've got one of those language
disorders. Dyslexia or something.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
Brander's going full tilt now. &quot;You've heard the phrase <i>Entropy
increases</i>? Everything falls apart eventually. You can postpone it
for a while, but that takes energy. The more complicated the system,
the more energy it needs to stay in one piece. Back before us
everything was sun-powered, all the plants were like these little
solar batteries that everything else could build on. Only now we've
got this society that's on an exponential complexity curve, and the
'net's on the same curve only a lot <i>steeper</i>, right? So we're
all balled up in this runaway machine, it's got so complicated it's
always on the verge of flying apart, and the only thing that prevents
that is all the energy we feed it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bad
news,&quot; Caraco says. Clarke doesn't think she's really getting
the point, though.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good
news, actually. They'll always need more energy, so they'll always
need us. Even if they ever <i>do</i> get fusion figured out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,
but&quot; Caraco's frowning all of a sudden. &quot;If you say
it's exponential, then it hits a wall eventually, right? The curve
goes straight up and down.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
nods. &quot;Yup.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
that's infinity. There's no way you could keep things from falling
apart, no matter how much power we pump out. It'd never be enough.
Sooner or later&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sooner,&quot;
says Brander, &quot;And that's why I'm staying right here. Like I
said, it's safer.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks from Brander to Caraco to Brander. &quot;That is just so much
bullshit.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
so?&quot; Brander doesn't seem offended.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Because
we'd have heard about it before now. Especially if it's based on some
kind of physical law everyone knows about. They couldn't keep
something like that under wraps, people would keep figuring it out
for themselves.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh,
I think they have,&quot; Brander says mildly, smiling from naked
brown eyes. &quot;They'd just rather not think about it too much.&quot;</font></font></p>

nods. &quot;I always thought you were too smart to be a Rifter.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey.
A rifter's the smartest thing to <i>be</i> right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
you chose to come down here? You actually applied?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
frowns. &quot;Sure. Didn't you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
got a phone call. Offered me this new high-paying career, even said I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Public
relations. Mostly Honquarium franchises.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>You?</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
I wasn't very good at it. What about you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Me?&quot;
Caraco bites her lip. &quot;It was sort of a deal. One year with an
option to renew, in lieu of prosecution.&quot; The corner of her
mouth twitches. &quot;Price of revenge. It was worth it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
turns to follow Brander's stare. The sofa's empty. Down the corridor,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Still,
it'll only be a short wait. Lubin's already been inside for four

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander

got the range topped out. Occasionally a small blip appears between
two of the larger ones: Lubin, lazing through an uneventful shift.</font></font></p>

hovers at the very edge of Beebe's vision. Distance and diffraction

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There

the screen now, almost indiscernible. Two large, unidentified
objects, now rising just barely clear of the bottom clutter, now
sinking back down into mere noise.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Gone.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,&quot;
Clarke says, pointing. There's a tremor rippling along the seismo
display, setting off sensors in a wave from the northwest. Nakata
taps commands, gets a retrodict bearing on the epicenter.
Three-twenty.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nothing
anyone bothered to tell us about, anyway.&quot; Clarke rubs the
bridge of her nose. &quot;So who's coming?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
nods. Nakata shakes her head. &quot;I'll wait for Judy.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh,
that's right. She's going all the way today, isn't she? Surface and

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.
She should be back in maybe an hour.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;
Brander's on his way downstairs. Clarke reaches past Nakata and taps
into an outside channel. &quot;Hey Ken. Wake up.&quot; </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
cruises just below her, lit from underneath by a seabed on fire. The
world ripples with color, blues and yellows and greens so pure it
almost hurts to look at them. A dusting of violet stars coalesces and
sweeps across the bottom; a school of shrimp, royally luminous.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Has
anyone been&quot; Clarke begins, but she feels wonder and
surprise from Brander. It's obvious he hasn't seen this before. And
Lubin &quot;It's news to me,&quot; Lubin answers aloud, as
dark as ever.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
gorgeous,&quot; Brander says. &quot;We've been down here how long,

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Except
Gerry, maybe.</i> Every now and then Beebe's sonar picks someone up
in this direction, when everyone else is accounted for. Not this far
out, of course, but who knows how far afield Fischer or
whatever Fischer's become wanders these days?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
drops away from his squid and coasts down, one arm outstretched.
Clarke watches him scoop something off the bottom. A faint tingle
clouds her mind for a moment that indefinable sense of some
other mind working nearby and she's past him, her own squid
towing her away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey
Len,&quot; Brander buzzes after her. &quot;Check this out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
releases the throttle and arcs back. Brander's got a glassy jointed
creature in the palm of his hand. It looks a bit like that shrimp
Acton found, back when</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander's
mask stares back at her. &quot;Why would I hurt it? I just wanted to
you to see its eyes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
something about the way Brander's radiating. It's as though he's a
little bit out of synch with himself, somehow, as though his brain is
broadcasting on two bands at once. Clarke shakes her head. The
sensation passes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
doesn't <i>have</i> eyes,&quot; she says, looking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sure
it does. Just not on its head.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
flips it over, uses thumb and forefinger to pin it upside-down
against the palm of his other hand. Rows of limbs legs, maybe,
or gills scramble uselessly for purchase. Between them, where
joints meet body, a row of tiny black spheres stare back at Lenie
Clarke.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Weird,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
feeling it again: a strange, almost prismatic sense of fractured
awareness.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
lets the creature go. &quot;Makes sense. Seeing as how all the light
down here comes from below.&quot; Suddenly he looks at Clarke,
radiating confusion. &quot;Hey Len, you feeling okay?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Split</i>,&quot;
they say, simultaneously.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Realization.
She doesn't know how much of it is hers and how much she's tuning in
from Brander, but suddenly they both know.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There's
someone else here,&quot; Brander says, unnecessarily.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks around. <i>Lubin.</i> She can't see him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Shit.
You think that's it?&quot; Brander's scanning the water too. &quot;You
think ol' Ken is finally starting to tune in?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Mike.
Lenie.&quot; Lubin's voice, faintly, from somewhere ahead.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks at Brander. Brander looks back.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Right
here,&quot; Brander calls, edging his volume up.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
found it,&quot; Lubin says, invisibly distant.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
launches off the bottom and grabs her squid. Brander's right beside
her, sonar pistol out and clicking. &quot;Got him,&quot; he says
after a moment. &quot;That way.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
else?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
tweaks the throttle. Brander follows. A riot of fractured color
unspools below them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ahead
of them, a mesh of green light sections the bottom into squares.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lasers,&quot;
Brander says. &quot;I think.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Emerald
threads float perfectly straight, a luminous profusion of right
angles a few centimeters off the bottom. Beneath them, drab metal
pipes run along the rock; tiny prisms erupt at regular intervals
along their length, like spines. Each prism, an interstice; from each
interstice, four beams of coherent light, and four, and four, a
wire-frame checkerboard overlaid against bedrock.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
cruise two meters over the grid. &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Brander
grates, &quot;but I think it's all just one beam. Reflected back
across itself.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Mike&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see it,&quot; he says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At
first it's just a fuzzy green column resolving out of the middle
distance. Nearness brings clarity; the beams crisscrossing the ocean
floor converge in a circle here, bend vertically up to form the
luminous bars of a cylindrical cage. Within that cage a thick metal
stalk rises out of the seabed. A great disk flowers at its top,
spreads out like some industrial parasol. The spokes of laser light
stream down from its perimeter and bounce endlessly away along the
bottom.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
like a a carousel,&quot; Clarke buzzes, remembering an old
picture from an even older time. &quot;Without horses...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Don't
block those beams,&quot; Lubin buzzes. He's hanging off to one side,
aiming a sonar pistol at the structure. &quot;They're too weak to
hurt you unless you get it in the eye, but you don't want to
interfere with what they're doing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
that is?&quot; Brander says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
doesn't answer. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>What
in the world</i> But Clarke's confusion is only partly
directed at the mechanism before her. The rest dwells on a
disorienting sense of alien cognition, very strong now, not her, not
Brander, but somehow familiar.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Ken?

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;This
isn't what we saw on sonar,&quot; Brander's saying. Clarke feels his
confusion even as he talks over it. &quot;Whatever we saw was moving
around.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Whatever

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin's
got another instrument out now. Clarke can't see the visual readout

Nakata's voice comes to them in the endless darkness between Beebe
and the Land of the Carousel.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Judy</i>&quot;
it whispers, almost too faint to make out. &quot;<i>scatter

Clarke's got her vocoder cranked loud enough to hurt her own ears.
&quot;We can't hear you. Say again?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>just

can barely distinguish the words. Somehow, though, she can hear the
fear in them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
small tremor shudders past, raising clouds of mud and swamping
Nakata's signal. Lubin throttles up his squid and pulls away. Clarke
and Brander follow suit. Somewhere in the darkness ahead, Beebe draws
closer in decibel fractions.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
next words they hear manage to cut through the noise: &quot;Judy's
gone!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gone?&quot;
Brander echoes. &quot;Gone where?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She
just disappeared!&quot; The voice hisses softly from every direction.
&quot;I was talking to her. She was up above the deep scattering
layer, she was I was telling her about the signal we saw and
she said she saw something too and then she was <i>gone...</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Did
you check sonar?&quot; Lubin wants to know.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes!
Yes of course I checked the sonar!&quot; Nakata's words are
increasingly clear. &quot;As soon as she was cut off I checked but I
saw nothing for sure. There was something, maybe, but the scattering
layer is very thick today, I could not be sure. And it's been fifteen
minutes now and she still hasn't come back...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sonar
wouldn't pick her up anyway,&quot; Brander says softly. &quot;Not

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
Just something, she said, and then I heard nothing more.&quot;</font></font></p>

dump her out of the airlock, still caught in the tangleweb. She knows
better than to fight under these conditions, but the situation's got
to change pretty soon. She thinks they may have tried gassing her in
the 'lock. Why else would they leave their headsets on after the lock
had drained? What about that faint hiss that lasted a few seconds too
long after blowdown? It's a pretty subtle cue, but you don't spend
most of a year on the rift without learning what an airlock sounds
like. There was something a bit off about that one. </font></font>

matter. You'd be surprised how much O&shy;<font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><sub>2</sub></font>
can be electrolyzed from just the little bit of water left sloshing
around in the ol' thoracic plumbing. Judy Caraco can hold her breath
until the cows come home, whatever the fuck <i>that</i> means. And
now, maybe they think their gas-chamber-that-blows-like-an-airlock
has got her doped or unconscious or just very laid back. Maybe now
they'll take her out of this fucking net.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
waits, limp. Sure enough there's a soft electrical cackle and the web
falls away, all those sticky molecular tails polarizing flat like
Velcro slicking down to cat fur. She stares out through glassy
unblinking eyecaps no cues they can read <i>there&shy;</i>
and counts three, with maybe more behind her. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They're
zombies, or something.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Their
skin looks rotten with jaundice. Fingernails are barely
distinguishable from fingers. Faces are slightly distorted, blurred
behind stretched, yellowish membrane. Waxy, dark ovals protrude
through the film where their mouths should be.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Body
condoms</i>, Caraco realizes after a moment. <i>What is this? Do they
think I'm contagious?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
a moment later: <i>Am I?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
of them reaches towards her holding something like a handgun.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
lashes out with one arm. She'd rather have kicked more
strength in the legs but the refsuckers that brought her in
didn't bother taking off her flippers. She connects: a nose, it feels
like. A nose under latex. A satisfying crunch. Someone's found sudden
cause to regret their own presumption.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a moment's shocked silence. Caraco uses it, flips onto her side and
swings one flippered foot backwards, heel first, into the back of
someone's knee. A woman cries out, a startled face topples past, a
smear of red hair plastered against its cheek, and Judy Caraco is
reaching down to get those big clown-foot flippers off in time to</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
tip of a shockprod hovers ten centimeters from her nose. It doesn't
waver a millimeter. After a moment's indecision <i>how far can
I push this, anyway?</i> Caraco stops moving.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Get
up,&quot; says the man with the prod. She can barely see, through the
condom, shadows where his eyes should be.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Slowly,
she takes off her fins and stands. She never had a chance, of course.
She knew that all along. But they obviously want her alive for
something, or they would never have bothered bringing her on board.
And she, in turn, wants to make it clear that these fuckers are <i>not</i>
going to intimidate her, no matter <i>how</i> many of them there are.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
catharsis to be had in even a losing fight.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Calm
down,&quot; the man says one of four, she sees now, including
the one backing out of the compartment with a red stain spreading
under his caul. &quot;We're not trying to hurt you. But you know you
shouldn't have tried to leave.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Leave?&quot;
His clothes all of their clothes are uniform but not
uniforms: loose-fitting white jumpsuits with an unmistakable look of
disposability. No insignia. No name tags. Caraco turns her attention
to the sub itself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Now
we're going to get you out of that diveskin,&quot; the prodmaster
continues. &quot;And we're going to give you a quick medical workup.
Nothing too intrusive, I assure you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
a large craft, judging from the curvature of the bulkhead. But fast.
Caraco knew that from the moment it resolved out of the murk above
her. She didn't see much, then, but she saw enough. This boat has
wings. It could lap an orca on steroids.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Who
<i>are</i> you guys?&quot; she asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Your
cooperation would make us all very grateful,&quot; Prodmaster says,
as if she hasn't spoken, &quot;And then maybe you can tell us exactly
what you're trying to escape from out here in the middle of the
Pacific.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Escape?&quot;
Caraco snorts. &quot;I was doing <i>laps</i>, you idiot.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot; He returns his shockprod to a holster on his belt, leaves
one hand resting lightly on the handle.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
gun is back, in different hands. It looks like a cross between a
staple gun and a circuit-tester. The redhead pushes it firmly onto
Caraco's shoulder. Caraco controls the urge to push back. A faint
electrical tingle and her diveskin drops away in pieces. There go her
arms. There go her legs. Her torso splits like a molting insect and
drops away, short-circuited. She stands utterly 'skinned, surrounded
by strangers. A naked mulatto woman looks back at her from a mirror
on the bulkhead. Somehow, even stripped, she looks strong. Her eyes,
brilliant white in that dark face, are cold and invulnerable. She
smiles.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
wasn't too bad, was it.&quot; There's a trained kindness to the other
woman's voice. <i>Almost like I didn't just dump her on the deck.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
lead her through a passageway to a table in a compact Med cubby. The
redhead places a membrane-sheathed hand on Caraco's arm, her touch
just slightly sticky; Caraco shrugs it off. There's only room for two
others in here besides Caraco. Three squeeze in: the redhead, the
prodmaster, and a shorter male, a bit chubby. Caraco looks at his
face, but she can't see details under the condom.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
hope you can see <i>out</i> of that thing better than I can see in,&quot;
she says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
soft background humming, too monotonous to register until now, rises
subtly in pitch. There's a sense of sudden acceleration; Caraco
staggers a bit, catches herself on the table.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;If
you could just lie back, Ms. Caraco&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They
stretch her out on the table. The chubby male pastes a few leads at
strategic points along her body and proceeds to take very small
pieces out of her. &quot;No, this isn't good. Not at all.&quot;
Cantonese accent. &quot;Poor epithelial turgor, you know dive<i>skin</i>'s
only an expression, you weren't supposed to <i>live</i> in it.&quot;
The touch of his fingers on her skin: like the redhead's, thin sticky
rubber. &quot;Now look at you,&quot; he says. &quot;Half your
sebaceous glands are shut down, your vit K's low, you haven't been
taking your UV either have you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
doesn't answer. Mr. Canton continues to draw samples on her left. At
the other side of the table, the redhead offers what she probably
thinks is a reassuring smile, mostly hidden behind the oval
mouthpiece.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Down
at Caraco's feet, just in front of the hatchway, Prodmaster stands
motionless.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,
too much time sealed up in that diveskin,&quot; says Mr. Canton. &quot;Did
you <i>ever</i> take it off? Even outside?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
redhead leans forward confidentially. &quot;It's important, Judy.
There could be health complications. We really should know if you
ever opened up outside. For an emergency of some kind, maybe.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;If
your 'skin was punctured, for example.&quot; Mr. Canton
affixes some kind of ocular device onto the membrane over his left
eye, peers into Caraco's ear. &quot;That scar on your leg, for
instance. Quite large.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
redhead runs a finger along the crease in Caraco's calf. &quot;Yeah.
One of those big fish, I guess?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
stares up at her. &quot;You guess.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
must have been a deep wound.&quot; Mr. Canton again. &quot;Is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Is
it what?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
souvenir from one of those famous monsters?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't have my medical records?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
would be easier if you'd save us the trouble of looking them up,&quot;
the redhead explained.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
in a hurry?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Prodmaster
takes a step forward. &quot;Not really. We can wait. But in the
meantime, maybe we should get those eyecaps out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>No.</i>&quot;
The thought scares her to the core. She's not sure why</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't need them any more, Ms. Caraco.&quot; A smile, a civilized
baring of teeth. &quot;You can relax. You're on your way home.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fuck
that. They stay in.&quot; She sits up, feels the leads tearing off
her flesh.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Suddenly
her arms are pinned. Mr. Canton on one side, the redhead on the
other.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Fuck
you.</i>&quot; She lashes out with one foot. It goes low, catches
Prodmasters' shock stick and flips it right out of the holster and
onto the deck. Prodmaster jumps back out of the cubby, leaving his
weapon behind. Suddenly Caraco's arms are free. Mr. Canton and the
redhead are backing right off, squeezing along the walls of the
compartment as though desperate to avoid physical contact</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>As
well you might be</i>, she thinks, grinning<i>. Don't try your cute
little power games with me, assholes</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
oriental shakes his head, a mixture of sadness and disapproval. Judy
Caraco's body <i>hums,</i> right down in the bones, and goes
completely limp.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
falls back onto the neoprene padding, nerves singing in the table's
neuroinduction field. She tries to move but all her motor synapses
are shorted out. The machines in her chest twitch and stutter,
listening for orders, interpreting static.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
lung sighs flat under its own weight. She can't summon the strength
to fill it up again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They're
tying her down. Wrists, ankles, chest, all strapped and cinched back
against the table. She can't even blink.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
humming stops. Air rushes down her throat and fills her chest. It
feels good to gasp again. &quot;How's her heart?&quot; Prodmaster.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good.
Bit of defib at first, but okay now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Mr.
Canton bends over from the head of the table: maggot skin stretched
across a human face. &quot;It's okay, Ms. Caraco. We're just here to
help you. Can you understand?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
tries to talk. It's an effort. &quot;g-g-g-g-GO.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Th-this
is Scanlon's work. Right? S-Scanlon's fucking revenge.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Mr.
Canton looks up at someone beyond Caraco's field of view.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Industrial
psych.&quot; The redhead's voice. &quot;No one important.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
looks back down. &quot;Ms. Caraco, I don't know what you're talking
about. We're going to take your eyecaps out now. It won't do you any
good to struggle. Just relax.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Hands
hold her head in position. Caraco clamps her eyes shut; they pry the
left one open. She stares into something like a big hypo with a disk
on the end. It settles on her eyecap, bonds with a faint sucking
sound.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
pulls away. Light floods in like acid.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
wrenches her head to one side and shuts her eye against the stinging.
Even filtered through her closed eyelid the light burns, an orange
fire bringing tears. Then they have her again, twisting her head
forward, fumbling at her face</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Turn

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Her
irises haven't had to work for almost a year,&quot; the redhead

A rattle of instruments.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sorry
about that, Ms. Caraco. We've lowered the lights now, is that
better?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Go
away. Leave me alone.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ms.
Caraco, I'm sorry, but we still have to remove your other cap.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
keeps her eyes squeezed shut. They pull the cap out of her face
anyway. The straps loosen around her body, drop off. She hears them
backing away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ms.
Caraco, we've turned the lights down. You can open your eyes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>The
lights. I don't care about the fucking lights. </i>She curls up on

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Shut
up, Burton. You can be a real asshole sometimes, you know that?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
sound of an airtight hatch hissing shut. A dense, close silence
settles on Caraco's eardrums.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An
electrical hum. &quot;Judy.&quot; the redhead's voice: not in person,
this time. From a speaker somewhere. &quot;We don't want this to be
any worse than it has to be.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Caraco
holds her knees tightly against her chest. She can feel the scars
there, a raised web of old tissue from the time they cut her open.
Eyes still shut, she runs her fingers along the ridges.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
want my eyes back.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
all she has now are these naked, fleshy things that anyone can see.
She opens them the merest crack, peeks between her fingers. She's
alone.</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Found
out what?</i>&quot; she cries, her face in hands. &quot;I was just...
exercising...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
okay, Judy. There's no hurry. You can rest now, if you want. Oh, and
there are clothes in the drawer on your right.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shakes her head. She doesn't care about clothes, she's been naked in

she got detoured by a current at the thermocline,&quot; the speaker

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It

scattering layer rises with darkness, spreads thin near the surface
until daylight chases it back down. &quot;And we'd be able to get her
voice channel even if sonar couldn't get through. But maybe we should
go up there ourselves and look around.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
That won't be necessary,&quot; says the speaker. &quot;In fact, it

Caraco.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
we don't even <i>look</i> for her?&quot; Nakata looks at the others,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ms.
Nakata, we <i>are</i> looking for her. We've already scrambled a
search team to scour the surface. But you're in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean. You simply don't have the resources to cover the
necessary volume.&quot; A deep breath, carried flawlessly down four
hundred kilometers of fiberop. &quot;On the other hand, if Ms. Caraco
is at all mobile, she'll most likely try and make it back to Beebe.
If you want to search, your best odds are to look close to home.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
looks helplessly around the room. Lubin stands expressionless; after

sorry. We don't know. It's just unfortunate that she wandered so far
from Beebe. The ocean, it's well, not always safe. It's even

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What

Brander says sharply.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
gives Lubin a blank angry stare and disappears from the hatchway.

especially.&quot; </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
I've got to wonder why you chose this moment to grill the GA about
the technical specs on a fucking seismic rig.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah?&quot;
Brander rises, twisting up out of the console chair. &quot;And just
what&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Mike,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
why lie to us?&quot; Brander asks, &quot;when we can just go out

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
why I stopped going up with her, did you know that?&quot; Nakata
shakes her head, remembering. &quot;We ran into something alive, up
midwater. It was horrible. Some kind of jellyfish, I think. It
<i>pulsed</i>, and it had these thin watery tentacles that stretched
out of sight, just hanging there in the water. And it had all these
these stomachs. Like fat squirming slugs. And each one had its own
mouth, and they were all opening and closing...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
screws up her face. &quot;Sounds lovely.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
didn't even see it. It was quite translucent, and I was not looking
and I bumped into it and it started <i>ejecting</i> pieces of itself.
The main body just went completely dark and pulled into itself and
pulsed away and all these shed stomachs and mouths and tentacles were
left behind, they were all glowing and writhing as though they were
in pain...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think I'd stop going up there too, after that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
strange thing was, I envied it in a way.&quot; Nakata's eyes brim,
spill over, but her voice doesn't change. &quot;It must be nice to
just be able to to cut yourself off from the parts that give
you away.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
smiles, imagining. &quot;Yes.&quot; She realizes, suddenly, that only
a few centimeters separate her from Alice Nakata. They're almost
touching.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>How
long have I been sitting here?</i> she wonders. She shifts on the
pallet, pulls away out of habit. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Judy
didn't see it that way,&quot; Nakata's saying. &quot;She felt sorry
for the <i>pieces</i>. I think she was almost angry with the main
body, do you believe it? She said it was this blind stupid blob, she
said what did she say 'fucking typical bureaucracy,
first sign of trouble it sacrifices the very parts that keep it fed.'
That's what she said.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
smiles. &quot;That sounds like Judy.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;She
never takes shit from anyone,&quot; Nakata says. &quot;She always
fights back. I like that about her, I could never do that. When
things get bad I just...&quot; She glances at the little black device
stuck on the wall beside her pillow. &quot;I dream.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
nods and says nothing. She can't remember Alice Nakata ever being so
talkative. &quot;It's so much better than VR, you have much more
control. In VR you are stuck with someone else's dreams.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
I hear.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
have never tried it?&quot; Nakata asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lucid
dreaming? A couple of times. I never got into it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
shrugs. &quot;My dreams don't have much... detail.&quot; <i>Or too
much, sometimes</i>. She nods at Nakata's machine. &quot;Those things
wake me up just enough to notice how vague everything is. Or
sometimes, when there <i>is</i> any detail it's something really
stupid. Worms crawling through your skin or something.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
you can control that. That is the whole point. You can <i>change</i>
it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>In
your dreams, maybe.</i> &quot;But you have to see it first. Just sort
of spoiled the effect for me, I guess. And mostly there were those
big, vague gaps.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah.&quot;
A flicker of a smile. &quot;For myself that is not a problem. The
world is pretty vague to me even when I am awake.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well.&quot;
Clarke smiles back, tentatively. &quot;Whatever works.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">More
silence.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
just wish I <i>knew</i>,&quot; Nakata says finally.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
glances down. Clarke follows, notices that her own hands have somehow
clasped around Nakata's. She supposes it's a gesture of support. It
feels okay. She squeezes, gently.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
looks back up. Her dark naked eyes still startle, somehow.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie,
she did not <i>mind</i> me. I pulled away, and I dreamed, and
sometimes I just went crazy and she put up with all of it. She
understoo she under<i>stands</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You

I don't think he meant to be insensitive before. He's on our side.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
put us here because this is where we belong,&quot; Nakata says,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For
a week now, Yves Scanlon's world had measured five meters by eight.
In all that time he had not seen another living soul.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
were plenty of ghosts, though. Faces passed across his workstation,
full of cheerful concern about his comfort, his diet, whether the
latest gastrointestinal tap had made him uncomfortable. There were
poltergeists, too. Sometimes they possessed the medical teleoperator
that hung from the ceiling, made it dance and stab and steal slivers
of flesh from Scanlon's body. They spoke with many voices, but rarely
said anything of substance. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
probably nothing, Dr. Scanlon,&quot; the teleop said once, a talking
exoskeleton. &quot;Just a preliminary report from Rand/Washington,
some new pathogen on the rift... probably benign...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Or,
in a pleasant female voice: &quot;You're obviously in exc good
health, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. Still, you know how
careful we have to be these days, even acne would mutate into a
plague if we let it, heh heh heh now we just another two
c.c.'s...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
a few days Scanlon had stopped asking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Whatever
it was, he knew it had to be serious. The world was full of nasty
microbes, new ones spawned by accident, old ones set free from dark
corners of the world, common ones mutated into novel shapes. Scanlon
had been quarantined before a couple of times. Most people had. It
usually involved technicians in body condoms, nurses trained to
maintain spirits with a well-timed joke. He'd never heard of
everything being done by remote control before.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Maybe
it was a security issue. Maybe the GA didn't want the news leaking
out, so they'd minimized the personnel involved. Or maybe
maybe the potential danger was so great that they didn't want to risk
live techs.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Every
day Scanlon discovered some new symptom. Shortness of breath.
Headaches. Nausea. He was astute enough to wonder if any of them were
real.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
occurred to him, with increasing frequency, that he might not get out
of there alive. </font></font>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
resembling Patricia Rowan haunted his screen every now and then,
asking questions about vampires. Not even a ghost, really. A
simulation, masquerading as flesh and blood. Its machinery showed
through in subtle repetitions, derivative conversational loops, a
fixation on keyword over concept. Who was in charge down there, it
wanted to know. Did Clarke carry more weight than Lubin? Did Brander
carry more weight than Clarke? As if anyone could glean the essence
of those twisted, fantastic creatures with a few inept questions. How
many years had it taken Scanlon to achieve his level of expertise? </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was rumored that Rowan didn't like real-time phone conversations.
Corpses were always paranoid about security or some such thing.
Still, it made Scanlon angry. It was her fault that he was here now,
after all. Whatever he'd caught on the rift he'd caught because she'd
ordered him down there, and now all she sent to him were <i>puppets</i>?
Did she really consider him that inconsequential? </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
never complained, of course. His aggression was too passionately
passive. Instead, he toyed with the model she sent. It was easy to
fool, programmed to look for certain words and phrases in answers to
any given question. Just a trained dog, really, grabbing and fetching
at the right set of commands. It was only when it ran back home,
eager jaws clamped around some utterly useless bit of trivia, that
its master would realize how truly ambiguous certain key phrases
could be...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
lost count of the times he sent it back, sated on junk food. It kept
returning, but it never learned.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
patted the teleop. &quot;<i>You're</i> probably smarter than that
döppleganger of hers, you know. Not that that's saying much. But
at least you get your pound of flesh on the first try.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Surely
by now Rowan knew what he was doing. Maybe this was some sort of
game. Maybe, eventually, she'd admit defeat, come seek an audience in
person. That hope kept him playing. Without it he would have given up
and cooperated out of sheer boredom.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">On
the first day of his quarantine he'd asked one of the ghosts for a
dreamer, and been refused. Normal circadian metabolism was a
prerequisite for one of the tests, it said; they didn't want his
tissues cheating. For several days after that Scanlon hadn't been
able to sleep at all. Then he'd fallen into a dreamless abyss for
twenty-eight hours. When he'd finally awakened his body had ached
from an unremembered wave of microsurgical strikes. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Impatient
little bastard, aren't you?&quot; he'd murmured to the teleop. &quot;Can't
even wait until I'm awake? I hope it was good for you.&quot; He'd
kept his voice low, in case there were any active pickups in the
room. None of the workstation ghosts seemed to know anything about
psychology; they were all physiologists and tinkertoy jocks. If
they'd caught him talking to a machine they might think he was going
crazy.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now
he was sleeping a full nine hours daily. Unpredictable attacks by the
poltergeists cost him maybe an hour on top of that. Crew reports and
IPD profiles, none of which ever seemed to come from Beebe Station,
appeared regularly in his terminal: another four or five hours a day.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
rest of the time he watched television.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Strange
things happening out there. A mysterious underwater explosion on the
MidAtlantic Ridge, big enough for a nuke but no confirmation one way
or the other. Israel and Tanaka-Krueger had both recently reactivated
their nuclear testing programs, but neither admitted to any knowledge
of this particular blast. The usual protests from corps and countries
alike. Things were getting even testier than usual. Just the other
day, it came out that N'AmPac, several weeks earlier, had responded
to a relatively harmless bit of piracy on the part of a Korean
muckraker by blowing it out of the water.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Regional
news was just as troubling. An estimated three hundred dead after a
firebomb took out most of the Urchin Shipyards outside Portland. It
was a fairly hefty death toll for two a.m., but Urchin property
abutted the Strip and a number of refs had been caught in the
firestorm. No known motive. Certain similarities to a much smaller
explosion a few weeks earlier and a few hundred kilometers further
north, in the Coquitlam Burb. That one had been attributed to gang
warfare.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
speaking of the Strip: more unrest among refugees forever hemmed in
along the coastline. The usual rationale from the usual municipal
entities. Waterfront's the only available real estate these days, and
besides, can you imagine what it would cost to install sewer systems
for seven million if we let them come <i>inland</i>?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another
quarantine, this time over some nematode recently escaped from the
headwaters of the Ivindo. No news of anything from the North Pacific.
Nothing from Juan de Fuca. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Two
weeks into his sentence Scanlon realized that the symptoms he'd
imagined earlier had all disappeared. In fact, in a strange way he
actually felt better than he had in years. Still they kept him locked
up. There were more tests to be done.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Over
time his initial sharp fears subsided to a chronic dull ache in the
stomach, so diffuse he barely felt it any more. One day he awoke with
a sense of almost frantic relief. Had he really ever thought that the
GA might wall him away forever? Had he really been so paranoid? They
were taking good care of him. Naturally: he was important to them.
He'd lost sight of that at first. But the vampires were still
problematic, or Rowan wouldn't be trolling her puppet through his
workstation. And the GA had chosen Yves Scanlon to study that problem
because they knew he was the best man for the job. Now they were just
protecting their investment, making sure he was healthy. He laughed
out loud at that earlier panicky self. There was really nothing to
worry about.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Besides,
he kept up with the news. It was safer in here. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
only spoke to it at night, of course. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
the day's samples and scans, when it was folded up against the
ceiling with its lights doused. He didn't want the ghosts listening
in. Not that it embarrassed him to confide in a machine. Scanlon knew
far too much about human behavior to worry over such a harmless
quirk. Lonely end-users were always falling in love with VR
simulations. Programmers bonded with their own creations, instilling
imaginary life into every utterly predictable response. Hell, people
even talked to their <i>pillows</i> if they were really short of
alternatives. The brain wasn't fooled, but the heart took comfort in
the pretense. It was perfectly natural, especially during periods of
prolonged isolation. Nothing to worry about at all. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
need me,&quot; Scanlon told it now, the ambient lighting damped down
until he could barely see. &quot;I know vampires, I know them better
than anyone. I've lived with them. I've survived them. These, these
<i>drybacks</i> up here only <i>use </i>them.&quot; He looked up. The
teleop hung above him like a bat in the dim light, and didn't
interact, and somehow that was the most comforting thing of all.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think Rowan's giving in. Her <i>puppet</i> said she was going to try
and find some time.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">No
answer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
shook his head at the sleeping machine. &quot;I'm losing it, you
know? I'm turning into a complete brainstem, is what I'm doing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
didn't admit it often these days. Certainly not with the same sense
of horror and uncertainty that he'd felt even a week before. But
after all he'd been through lately, it was only natural that he'd
have some adjustments to make. Here he was, quarantined, possibly
infected by some unknown germ. Before that he'd been through a
gauntlet that would have driven most people right over the brink. And
before <i>that</i>...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Yes,
he'd been through a lot. But he was a professional. He could still
turn around, take a good hard look at himself. More than most people
could do. Everyone had doubts and insecurities, after all. The fact
that he was strong enough to admit to his didn't make him a freak.
Quite the contrary.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
stared across to the far end of the room. A window of isolation
membrane stretched across the upper half of that wall, looked through
to a small dark chamber that had been empty since his arrival.
Patricia Rowan would be there soon. She would get first-hand benefit
of Scanlon's new insights, and if she didn't already know how
valuable he was, she'd be convinced after he spoke to her. The long
wait for recognition was almost over. Things were about to make a
huge change for the better. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Yves

suffered in here might be due entirely to some repressed asshole's

crazy. But Yves Scanlon was finally starting to see his place in the
universe, and was discovering that he could afford to be tolerant.
Other people's pettiness didn't bother him nearly as much as it used
to. He was above it.</font></font></p>

don't see the hurry,&quot; he complained. &quot;Nothing goes in or
out of me without you people turning a valve somewhere to let it
past. Why not just take what I send down the toilet?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
do that, too,&quot; the machine said, coring. &quot;Since you got

I didn't say it was harmless. Just said it might have turned into
something else. Or maybe it <i>is </i>harmless. Maybe you just pissed
off someone upstairs.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon

and neatly inserted the soiled probe into a dumbwaiter. By the time

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;See

Rowan stood in shadow on the other side. Her eyes glittered with
faint mercury: almost vampire eyes, but diluted. Translucent, not
opaque. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
contacts, of course. Scanlon had tried a similar pair once. They
linked into a weak RF signal from your watch, scrolled images across
your field of view at a virtual range of forty centimeters. Patricia
Rowan saw Scanlon and smiled. Whatever else she saw through those
magical lenses, he could only guess. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Dr.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He

about&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
nodded, opened her mouth.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;and
although your döpplegangers are perfectly adequate for normal

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Closed

given the kind of information you seem to be interested in.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
hesitated a moment. &quot;Yes. Of course. We, um, we need your
insights, Dr. Scanlon.&quot; Yes. Good. Of course. &quot;Your report
on Beebe was quite, well, interesting, but things have changed
somewhat since you filed it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
nodded thoughtfully. &quot;In what way?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lubin's
gone, for one thing.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gone?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Disappeared.
Dead, perhaps, although apparently there's no signal from his
deadman. Or possibly just regressed, like Fischer.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see. And have you learned whether anyone at the other stations has
gone over?&quot; It was one of the predictions he'd made in his
report.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
eyes, rippling silver, seemed to stare at a point just beside his
left shoulder. &quot;We can't really say. Certainly we've had some
losses, but rifters tend not to be very forthcoming with details. As
we expected, of course.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,
of course.&quot; Scanlon tried on a contemplative look. &quot;So
Lubin's gone. Not surprising. He was definitely closest to the edge.
In fact, if I remember I predicted&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Probably
just as well,&quot; Rowan murmured.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Excuse
me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shook her head, as if clearing it of some distraction. &quot;Nothing.
Sorry.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah.&quot;
Scanlon nodded again. No need to harp on Lubin if Rowan didn't want
to. He'd made lots of other predictions. &quot;There's also the
matter of the Ganzfeld effect I noted. The remaining crew&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,
we've spoken with a couple of other experts about that.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
don't think the rift environment is, <i>sufficiently impoverished </i>is
the way they put it. Not sufficiently impoverished to function as a
Ganzfeld.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see,&quot; Scanlon felt part of his old self bristling. He smiled,
ignoring it. &quot;How do they explain my observations?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Actually&quot;
Rowan coughed. &quot;They're not completely convinced you <i>did</i>
observe anything significant. Apparently there was some evidence that
your report was dictated under conditions of well, personal
stress.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
carefully froze his smile into place. &quot;Well. Everyone's entitled
to their opinion.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
said nothing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Although
the fact that the rift is a stressful environment shouldn't come as
news to any real <i>expert</i>,&quot; Scanlon continued. &quot;That
was the whole point of the program, after all.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
nodded. &quot;I don't disbelieve you, Doctor. I'm not really
qualified to judge one way or the other.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>True</i>,
he didn't say.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
in any event,&quot; Rowan added, &quot;You were there. They weren't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
relaxed. Of course she'd put his opinion ahead of those other
<i>experts</i>, whoever they were. He was the one she'd chosen to go
down there, after all. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
not really important,&quot; she said now, dismissing the subject.
&quot;Our immediate concern is the quarantine.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Mine
as well as theirs.</i> But of course he didn't let that on. It
wouldn't be professional to seem too concerned about
his own welfare right now. Besides, they were treating him fine in
here. At least he knew what was going on.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;yet,&quot;
Rowan finished.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
blinked. &quot;What? Excuse me?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
said, for obvious reasons we've decided not to recall the crew from
Beebe just yet.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see. Well, you're in luck. They don't want to leave.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
stepped closer to the membrane. Her eyes faded in the light. &quot;You're
sure of this.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.
The rift is their home, Ms. Rowan, in a way a layperson probably
couldn't understand. They're more alive down there than they ever
were on shore.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Besides, even if they wanted
to leave, what could they do? They're hardly going to swim all the
way back to the mainland.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
might, actually.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
possible,&quot; Rowan admitted. &quot;Theoretically. And we we
caught one of them, leaving.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>What</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Up
in the euphotic zone. We had a sub stationed up there, just to
keep an eye on things. One of the rifters Cracker, or&quot;
a glowing thread wriggled across each eye &quot;Caraco, that's
it. Judy Caraco. She was heading straight for the surface. They
figured she was making a break for it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
shook his head. &quot;Caraco does laps, Ms. Rowan. It was in my
report.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know. Perhaps your report should have been more widely distributed.
Although, her <i>laps</i> never took her that close to the surface
before. I can see why they&quot; Rowan shook her head. &quot;At
any rate, they took her. A mistake, perhaps.&quot; A faint smile.
&quot;Those happen, sometimes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
see,&quot; Scanlon said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
now we're in something of a situation,&quot; Rowan went on. &quot;Maybe
the Beebe crew thinks that Caraco was just another accidental
casualty. Or maybe they're getting suspicious. So do we let it lie,
hope things blow over? Will they make a break if they think we're
covering something up? Will some go and some stay? Are they a group,
or a collection of individuals?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
fell silent.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
lot of questions,&quot; Scanlon said after a while.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,
then. Here's just one. Would they obey a direct order to stay on the
rift?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
might stay on the rift,&quot; Scanlon said. &quot;But not because you
ordered them to.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
were thinking, maybe Lenie Clarke,&quot; Rowan said. &quot;According
to your report she's more or less the leader. And Lubin's
Lubin <i>was</i> the wild card. Now he's out of the picture,
perhaps Clarke could keep the others in line. If we can reach
Clarke.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
shook his head. &quot;Clarke's not any sort of leader, not in the
conventional sense. She adopts her own behaviors independently, and
the others just follow her lead. It's not the usual
authority-based system as you'd understand it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
if they follow her lead, as you say...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
suppose,&quot; Scanlon said slowly, &quot;she's the most likely to
obey an order to stay on site, no matter how hellish the situation.
She's hooked on abusive relationships, after all.&quot; He stopped.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
could always try telling them the truth,&quot; he suggested. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
nodded. &quot;It's a possibility, certainly. And how do you think
they'd react?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
said nothing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Would
they trust us?&quot; Rowan asked.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
smiled. &quot;Do they have any reason to?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Perhaps
not.&quot; Rowan sighed. &quot;But no matter what we tell, them, the
issue's the same. What will they do when they learn they're stuck
down there?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Probably
nothing. That's where they want to be.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
glanced at him curiously. &quot;I'm surprised you'd say that,
Doctor.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There's
no place I'd rather be than my own apartment. But the moment anyone
put me under house arrest I'd want very much to leave it, and I'm not
even slightly dysfunctional.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
let the last part slide. &quot;That's a point,&quot; he admitted.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
very basic one,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm surprised someone with your
background would miss it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
didn't <i>miss</i> it. I just think other factors <i>outweigh</i>
it.&quot; On the outside, Scanlon smiled. &quot;As you say, you're
not at all dysfunctional.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.
Not yet, anyway.&quot; Rowan's eyes clouded with a sudden flurry of
data. She stared into space for a moment or two, assessing. &quot;Excuse
me. Bit of trouble on another front.&quot; She focused again on
Scanlon. &quot;Do you ever feel guilty, Yves?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
laughed, cut himself off. &quot;Guilty? Why?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;About
the project. About what we did to them.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
happier down there. Believe me. I know.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Do
you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Better
than anyone, Ms. Rowan. You know that. That's why you came to me
today.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
didn't speak.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Besides,&quot;
Scanlon said, &quot;Nobody drafted them. It was their own free
choice.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,&quot;
Rowan agreed softly. &quot;Was.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
extended her arm through the window.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
isolation membrane coated her hand like liquid glass. It fit the
contours of her fingers without a wrinkle, painted palm and wrist and
forearm in a transparent sheath, pulled away just short of her elbow
and stretched back to the windowpane.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thanks
for your time, Yves,&quot; Rowan said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
a moment Scanlon shook the proffered hand. It felt like a condom,
slightly lubricated. &quot;You're welcome,&quot; he said. Rowan
retracted her arm, turned away. The membrane smoothed behind her like
a soap bubble.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But&quot;
Scanlon said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
turned back. &quot;Yes?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Was
that all you wanted?&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;For
now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ms.
Rowan, if I may. There's a lot about the people down there you don't
know. A lot. I'm the only one who can give it to you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
appreciate that, Y&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
whole geothermal program hinges on them. I'm sure you see that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
stepped back towards the membrane. &quot;I do, Dr. Scanlon. Believe
me. But I have a number of priorities right now. And in the meantime,
I know where to find you.&quot; Once more she turned away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
tried very hard to keep his voice level: &quot;Ms. <i>Rowan</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
changed in her then, a subtle hardening of posture that would have
gone unnoticed by most people. Scanlon saw it as she turned back to
face him. A tiny pit opened in his stomach.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
tried to think of what to say.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,
Dr. Scanlon,&quot; she said, her voice a bit too level.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know you're busy, Ms. Rowan, but how much longer do I have to
stay in here?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
softened fractionally. &quot;Yves, we still don't know. In a way it's
just another quarantine, but it's taking longer to get a handle on
this one. It's from the bottom of the ocean, after all.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
is it, exactly?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
not a biologist.&quot; She glanced at the floor for a moment, then
met his eyes again. &quot;But I can tell you this much: you don't
have to worry about keeling over dead. Even if you have this thing.
It doesn't really attack people.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
why&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Apparently
there are some agricultural concerns. They're more afraid of
the effect it might have on certain plants.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
considered that. It made him feel a little better. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
really have to go now.&quot; Rowan seemed to consider something for a
moment, then added, &quot;And no more döpplegangers. I promise.
That was rude of me.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She'd
told the truth about the döppelgangers. She'd lied about
everything else.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">After
four days Scanlon left a message in Rowan's cache. Two days later he
left another. In the meantime he waited for the spirit which had
thrust its finger up its ass to come back and tell him more about
primordial biochemistry. It never did. By now even the other ghosts
weren't visiting very often, and they barely said a word when they
did.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
didn't return Scanlon's calls. Patience melted into uncertainty.
Uncertainty simmered into conviction. Conviction began to gently
boil.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Locked
up in here for three fucking weeks and all she gives me is a
ten-minute courtesy call. Ten lousy minutes of
my-experts-say-you're-wrong and
it's-such-a-basic-point-I-can't-believe-you-missed-it and then she
just walks away. She just fucking smiles and walks away. </i></font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Know
what I <i>should</i> have done,&quot; he growled at the teleop. It
was the middle of the day but he didn't care any more. Nobody was
listening, they'd deserted him in here. They'd probably forgotten all
about him. &quot;What I <i>should</i> have done is rip a hole in that
fucking membrane when she was here. Let a little of whatever's in
<i>here</i> out to mix with the air in <i>her </i>lungs. Bet <i>that'd</i>
inspire her to look for some answers!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
knew it was fantasy. The membrane was almost infinitely flexible, and
just as tough. Even if he succeeded in cutting it, it would repair
itself before any mere gas molecules could jump through. Still, it
was satisfying to think about.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
satisfying enough. Scanlon picked up a chair and hurled it at the
window. The membrane caught it like a form-fitting glove, enfolded
it, let it fall almost to the floor on the other side. Then, slowly,
the window tightened down to two dimensions. The chair toppled back
into Scanlon's cell, completely undamaged.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
to think she'd had the fucking <i>temerity </i>to lecture him with
that inane little homily about house arrest! As though she'd caught
him in some sort of <i>lie</i>, when he'd suggested the vampires
might stay put. As though she thought he was <i>covering</i> for
them.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sure,
he knew more about vampires than anyone. That didn't mean he <i>was</i>
one. That didn't mean</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>We
could have treated you better</i>, Lubin had said, there at the last.
<i>We</i>. As though he'd been speaking for all of them. As though,
finally, they were <i>accepting</i> him. As though</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
vampires were damaged goods, always had been. That was the whole
point. How could Yves Scanlon qualify for membership in a club like
<i>that</i>?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
knew one thing, though. He'd rather be a vampire than one of these
assholes up <i>here</i>. That was obvious now. Now that the pretenses
were dropping away and they didn't even bother talking to him any
more. They exploited him and then they shunned him, they used him
just like they used the vampires. He'd always known that deep down,
of course. But he'd tried to deny it, kept it stifled under years of
accommodation and good intentions and misguided efforts to fit in. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">These
people were the enemy. They'd always been the enemy.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
they had him by the balls.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
spun around and slammed his fist into the examination table. It
didn't even hurt. He continued until it did. Panting, knuckles raw
and stinging, he looked around for something else to smash.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
teleop woke up enough to hiss and spark when the chair bounced off
its central trunk. One of the arms wiggled spastically for a moment.
A faint smell of burnt insulation. Then nothing. Only slightly
dented, the teleop slept on above a litter of broken paradigms.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Tip

tremor shivers through bedrock. The emerald grid fractures into a
jagged spiderweb. Strands of laser light bounce haphazardly into the
abyss.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From
somewhere within the carousel, a subtle discontent. Intensified
cogitation. The displaced beams waver, begin realigning themselves.</font></font></p>

Clarke has seen and felt all of this before. This time she watches
the prisms on the seabed, rotating and adjusting themselves like tiny

parallel, perpendicular, planar. Within seconds the grid is
completely restored. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Emotionless

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
streaks down from the darkness overhead, mindlessly singleminded, big
as Clarke and Brander put together. Its eyes reflect the glow from
the seabed. It slams into the top of the carousel, mouth open,
bounces away with half its teeth broken.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
has no thoughts, but Lenie Clarke can feel its emotions. They don't
change. Injury never seems to faze these monsters. Its next attack
targets one of the lasers. It skids around the roof of the carousel
and comes up from underneath, swallowing one of the beams. It rams
the emitter, and thrashes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
sudden vicarious tingle shoots along Clarke's spine. The creature

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
floats above her, looking down. &quot;Okay,&quot; he says at last.
&quot;Let me just dump what you got today and run it against the
rest. Then, if it pans out...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;About
time.&quot; Clarke grabs her squid off the bottom and tweaks the
throttle. &quot;Good.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
shakes his head. &quot;I don't think so. Not at all.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,
then. Smart gels are especially suited for coping with rapid changes
in topography, right?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
sits at the library. In front of him, one of the flatscreens cycles
through a holding pattern. Behind, Clarke and Lubin and Nakata do the
same.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
there are two ways for your topographic environment to change
rapidly,&quot; he continues. &quot;One, you move quickly through
complex surroundings. That's why we're getting gels in muckrakers and
ATVs these days. Or you could sit still, and let your <i>surroundings
</i>change.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
looks around. Nobody says anything. &quot;Well?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
it's thinking about earthquakes,&quot; Lubin remarks. &quot;The GA
told us that much.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
turns back to the console. &quot;Not just any earthquake,&quot; he
says, a sudden edge in his voice. &quot;The <i>same</i> earthquake.
Over and over again.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
touches an icon on the screen. The display rearranges itself into a
pair of axes, x and y. Emerald script glows adjacent to each line.
Clarke leans forward: <i>time</i>, says the abscissa. <i>Activity</i>,
says the ordinate.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
line begins to crawl left to right across the display.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;This
is a mean composite plot of every time we ever watched that thing,&quot;
Brander explains. &quot;I tried to pin some sort of units onto the
y-axis, but of course all we can tune in is <i>now it's thinking
hard, </i>or <i>now it's slacking off</i>. So you'll have to settle
for a relative scale. What you're seeing now is just baseline
activity.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
line shoots about a quarter of the way up the scale, flattens out.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Here
it's started thinking about something. I can't correlate this to any
real events like local tremors, it just seems to start on its own. An
internally-generated loop, I think.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Simulation,&quot;
Lubin grunts.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
it's thinking along like this for a while,&quot; Brander continues,
ignoring him, &quot;and then, <i>voila</i>...&quot; Another jump, to
halfway up the y-axis. The line holds its new altitude for a few
pixels, slides into a gentle decline for a pixel or two, then jumps
again. &quot;So here it started thinking <i>quite</i> hard, starts to
relax, then starts thinking even harder.&quot; Another, smaller jump,
another gradual decline. &quot;Here it's even more lost in thought,
but it takes a nice long break afterwards.&quot; Sure enough, the
decline continues uninterrupted for almost thirty seconds.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
right about <i>now</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
line shoots almost to the top of the scale, fluctuates near the top
of the graph. &quot;And here it just about gives itself a hemorrhage.
It goes on for a while, then&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
line plummets vertically.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;drops
right back to baseline. Then there's some minor noise, I think it's
storing its results or updating its files or something, and the whole
thing starts all over again.&quot; Brander leans back in his chair,
regards the rest with his hands clasped behind his head. &quot;That's
all it's been doing. As long as we've been watching it. The whole
cycle takes about fifteen minutes, give or take.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
it?&quot; Lubin says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Some
interesting variations, but that's the basic pattern.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
what does it mean?&quot; Clarke asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
leans forward again, towards the library. &quot;Suppose you were an
earthquake tremor, starting here on the rift and propagating east.
Guess how many faults you'd have to cross to get to the mainland.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
nods and says nothing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
eyes the graph, guesses: <i>five</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
doesn't even blink, but then, Nakata hasn't done much of anything for
days.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
points to the first jump. &quot;Us. Channer Vent.&quot; The second:
&quot;Juan de Fuca, Coaxial Segment.&quot; Third: &quot;Juan de Fuca,
Endeavour Segment.&quot; Fourth: &quot;Beltz minifrac.&quot; The last
and largest: &quot;Cascadia Subduction Zone.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
waits for their reaction. Nobody says anything. Faintly, from
outside, comes the sound of windchimes in mourning.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Jesus.
Look, any simulation is computationally most intensive whenever the
number of possible outcomes is greatest. When a tremor crosses a
fault it triggers ancillary waves perpendicular to the main direction
of travel. Makes for very hairy calculations at those points, if
you're trying to model the process.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
stares at the screen. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Christ,
Len, I'm basing it on stray emissions from a blob of fucking nerve
tissue. Of course I'm not sure. But I'll tell you this much: if you
assume that this first jump represents the initial quake, and this
last dropoff is the mainland, and you also assume a reasonably
constant speed of propagation, these intermediate spikes fall almost
exactly where Cobb, Beltz, and Cascadia would be. I don't think
that's a coincidence.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
frowns. &quot;But doesn't that mean the model stops running as soon
as it reaches N'AmPac? I would've thought that's when they'd be <i>most</i>
interested.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
bites his lip. &quot;Well, that's the thing. The lower the activity
near the end of a run, the longer the run seems to last.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
waits. She doesn't have to ask. Brander's far too proud of himself to
not explain further. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
if you assume that lower end-run activity reflects a smaller
predicted quake, the cheese spends more time thinking about quakes
with lower shoreline impact. Usually, though, it just stops when it
hits the coast.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There's
a threshold,&quot; Lubin says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Every
time it predicts a coastal quake above a certain threshold, the model
shuts down and starts over. Unacceptable losses. It spends more time
thinking about the milder ones, but so far they've all resulted in
unacceptable losses.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
nods, slowly. &quot;I was wondering about that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Stop
wondering.&quot; Lubin's voice is even more dead than usual. &quot;That
thing's only got one question on its mind.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
question?&quot; Clarke asks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lubin,
you're being paranoid,&quot; Brander snorts. &quot;Just because it's
a bit radioactive&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
lied to us. They took Judy. Even you're not naive enough &quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
question?&quot; Clarke asks again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
why?&quot; Brander demands. &quot;What would be the point?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Mike,&quot;
Clarke says, softly and clearly, &quot;<i>shut up.</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
blinks and falls silent. Clarke turns to Lubin. &quot;What question?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
watching the local plates. It's asking, what happens on N'AmPac if
there's an earthquake here, right now?&quot; Lubin parts his lips in
an expression few would mistake for a smile. &quot;So far it hasn't
liked the answer. But sooner or later predicted impact's going to
fall below some critical level.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
then what?&quot; Clarke says. <i>As if I didn't know.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
it blows up,&quot; says a small voice. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
nods.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;A
bomb big enough to cause a major earthquake three, four hundred
kilometers away?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,&quot;
Nakata says. &quot;All of those faults it would have to cross, they
would stop it. Firewalls.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Unless,&quot;
Lubin adds, &quot;one of those faults is just about ready to slip on
its own.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Cascadia</i>.
Nobody says it aloud. Nobody has to. One day, five hundred years ago,
the Juan de Fuca Plate developed an attitude. It got tired of being
endlessly ground under North America's heel. So it just stopped
sliding, hung on by its fingernails and dared the rest of the world
to shake it free. So far the rest of the world hasn't been able to.
But the pressure's been building now for half a millennium. It's only
a matter of time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks at Lubin. &quot;You're saying even a small bomb here could kick

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
what he's saying,&quot; Brander confirms. &quot;So why, Ken old
buddy? This some sort of Asian real estate scam? A terrorist attack
on N'AmPac?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Wait
a minute.&quot; Clarke holds up a hand. &quot;They're not trying to
<i>cause</i> an earthquake. They're trying to <i>avoid</i> one.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
nods. &quot;You set off a fusion charge on the rift, you trigger a
quake. Period. How serious depends on conditions at detonation. This
thing is just holding itself back until it causes as little damage as
possible, back on shore.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
snorts. &quot;Come on, Lubin, isn't this all kind of excessive? If

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;If
Lubin's right, who knows? Tomorrow, maybe. Ten years from now.
Earthquakes are classic chaotic systems, and the tectonics around
here change by the minute. If the Throat slips a millimeter it could
make the difference between a shiver and a meltdown.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Perhaps
it is a small-yield device,&quot; Nakata suggests hopefully. &quot;It

before it reaches us?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,&quot;

Brander says, &quot;It's almost two hundred kilometers to Cascadia.
If this thing can generate P-waves strong enough to kick it loose at
that range, we're not going to ride it out here. We might not get
vaporized, but the shockwave would tear us into little pieces.&quot;</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Even
if we get past its front-line defense, we're only seeing the top of

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There
have to be. At this depth it would take almost three hundred megatons
to generate a bubble even half a kilometer across. If they want to
take out any significant fraction of the vent, they'll need multiple
charges, distributed.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a moment's silence. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Three
hundred megatons,&quot; Brander repeats at last. &quot;You know, I
can't tell you how <i>disturbed </i>I am to find that you know such
things.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
shrugs. &quot;It's basic physics. It shouldn't intimidate anyone who
isn't totally innumerate.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
is standing again, his face only centimeters from Lubin's.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
I am getting pretty fucking disturbed by you too, Lubin,&quot; he
says through clenched teeth, &quot;Who the fuck <i>are </i>you,
anyway?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Mike,&quot;
Clarke begins.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,
I fucking <i>mean</i> it. We don't know shit about you, Lubin. We
can't tune you in, we sell your bullshit story to the drybacks for
you and you <i>still</i> haven't explained why, and now you're
mouthing off like some kind of fucking secret agent. You want to call
the shots, say so. Just drop this bullshit man-with-no-name routine.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
takes a small step back. <i>Okay. Fine. If he thinks he can fuck with
Lubin he's on his own.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
Lubin isn't showing any of the signs. No change in stance, no change
in breathing, his hands stay unclenched at his sides. When he speaks,
his voice is calm and even. &quot;If it'll make you feel any better,
by all means; call upstairs and tell them I'm still alive. Tell them
you lied. If they&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
eyes don't change. That flat white stare persists while the flesh
around it <i>twitches</i>, suddenly, and now Clarke <i>can </i>see
the signs, the slight lean forward, the subtle cording of veins and
tendons in the throat. Brander sees them too. He's standing still as
a dog caught in headlights.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Fuck
fuck fuck he's going to blow...</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she's wrong again. Impossibly, Lubin relaxes. &quot;As for your
endearing desire to get to know me,&quot; laying a casual hand
on Brander's shoulder &quot;you're luckier than you know that
that hasn't happened.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
takes back his hand, steps towards the ladder. &quot;I'll go along
with whatever you decide, as long as it doesn't involve tampering
with nuclear explosives. In the meantime, I'm going outside. It's
getting close in here.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
drops through the floor. Nobody else moves. The sound of the airlock
flooding seems especially loud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Jesus</i>,
Mike,&quot; Lenie breathes at last.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Since
when was he calling the shots?&quot; Brander seems to have regained
some of his bravado. He casts a hostile glance through the deck. &quot;I
don't trust that fucker. No matter what he says. Probably tuning us
in right now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;If
he is, I doubt he's picking up anything you haven't already shouted
at him.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Listen,&quot;
says Nakata. &quot;We must <i>do</i> something.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
throws his hands in the air. &quot;What choice is there? If we don't
disarm the fucking thing, we either get the hell out of here or we
sit around and wait to get incinerated. Not really a tough decision
if you ask me.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Isn't
it</i>, Clarke wonders.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
cannot leave by the surface,&quot; Nakata points out, &quot;if they
got Judy...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
we hug the bottom,&quot; Brander says. &quot;Right. Scam their sonar.
We'd have to leave the squids behind, they'd be too easy to track.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Nakata
nods.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie?
What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks up. Brander and Nakata are both staring at her. &quot;I didn't
say anything.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
look like you don't approve.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
three hundred klicks to Vancouver Island, Mike. Minimum. It could
take over a week to make it without squids, assuming we don't get
lost.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Our
compasses work fine once we're away from the rift. And it's a pretty
big continent, Len; we'd have to try pretty hard <i>not </i>to bump
into it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
what do we do when we get there? How would we make it past the
Strip?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Brander
shrugs. &quot;Sure. For all we know the refs could eat us alive, if
our tubes don't choke on all the shit floating around back there. But
really, Len, would you rather take your chances with a ticking nuke?
It's not like we're drowning in options.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Sure.&quot;
Clarke moves one hand in a gesture of surrender. &quot;Fine.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Your
problem, Len, is you've always been a fatalist,&quot; Brander
pronounces.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
has to smile at that. <i>Not always.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There
is also the question of food,&quot; Nakata says. &quot;To bring
enough for the trip will slow us considerably.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
don't want to leave,</i> Clarke realizes. <i>Even now. Isn't that
stupid.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;don't
think speed is much of a concern,&quot; Brander is saying. &quot;If
this thing goes off in the next few days an few extra meters per hour
won't to do us much good anyway.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
could travel light and forage on the way,&quot; Clarke muses, her
mind wandering. &quot;Gerry does okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Gerry,&quot;
Brander repeats, suddenly subdued.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
moment's silence. Beebe shivers with the small distant cry of Lubin's
memorial.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh
God,&quot; Brander says softly. &quot;That thing can really get on
your nerves after a while.&quot;</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
was a sound.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Not
a voice. It had been days since he'd heard any voice but his own. Not
the food dispenser or the toilet. Not the familiar crunch of his feet
over dismembered machinery. Not even the sound of breaking plastic or
the clang of metal under assault; he'd already destroyed everything
he could, given up on the rest.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">No,
this was something else. A hissing sound. It took him a few moments
to remember what it was. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
access hatch, pressurizing.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
craned his neck until he could see around the corner of an
intervening cabinet. The usual red light glowed from the wall to one
side of the big metal ellipse. It turned green as he watched. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
hatch swung open. Two men in body condoms stepped through, light from
behind throwing their shadows along the length of the dark room. They
looked around, not seeing him at first. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One
of them turned up the lights.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
squinted up from the corner. The men were wearing sidearms. They
looked down at him for a few moments, folds of isolation membrane
draped around their faces like leprous skin.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
sighed and pulled himself to his feet. Fragments of bruised
technology tinkled to the floor. The guards stood aside to let him
pass. Without a word they followed him back outside.</font></font></p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another
room. A strip of light divided it into two dark halves. It speared
down from a recessed groove in the ceiling, bisecting the wine
draperies and the carpet, laying a bright band across the conference
table. Tiny bright hyphens reflected from perspex workpads set into
the mahogany. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
line in the sand. Patricia Rowan stood well back on the other side,
her face half-lit in profile.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nice
room,&quot; Scanlon remarked. &quot;Does this mean I'm out of
quarantine?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
didn't face him. &quot;I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to stay on
your side of the light. For your own safety.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
yours?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
gestured at the light without looking. &quot;Microwave. UV too, I
think. You'd fry if you crossed it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah.
Well, maybe you've been right all along.&quot; Scanlon pulled a chair
out from the conference table and sat down. &quot;I developed a real
symptom the other day. My stools seem a bit off. Intestinal flora not
working properly, I guess.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry to hear it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
thought you'd be pleased. It's the closest thing to vindication
you've got to date.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Neither
person spoke for nearly a minute. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I...
I wanted to talk,&quot; Rowan said at last.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
did I. A couple of weeks ago.&quot; And then, when she didn't
respond: &quot;Why now?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
a therapist, aren't you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Neurocognitist.
And we haven't <i>talked</i>, as you put it, for decades. We
prescribe.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
lowered her face.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
see, I have,&quot; she began.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Blood
on my hands,&quot; she said a moment later.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
bet I know whose, too.</i> &quot;Then you really don't want me. You
want a priest.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
don't talk either. At least, they don't say much.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
curtain of light hummed softly, like a bug zapper. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Pyranosal
RNA,&quot; Scanlon said after a moment. &quot;Five-sided ribose ring.
A precursor to modern nucleic acids, pretty widespread about three
and a half billion years ago. The library says it would've made a
perfectly acceptable genetic template on its own; faster replication
than DNA, fewer replication errors. Never caught on, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
said nothing. She may have nodded, but it was hard to tell.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
much for your story about an <i>agricultural hazard</i>. So are you
finally going to tell me what's going on, or are you still into
role-playing games?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
shook herself, as though coming back from somewhere. For the first
time, she looked directly at Scanlon. The sterilight reflected off
her forehead, buried her eyes in black pools of shadow. Her contacts
shimmered like back-lit platinum.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
didn't seem to notice his condition.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
didn't lie to you, Dr. Scanlon. Fundamentally, you could call this an
agricultural problem. We're dealing with sort of a a soil
bacterium. Its not a pathogen at all, really. Its just
a competitor. And no, it never caught on. But as it turns out, it
never really died off, either.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
dropped into a chair.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Do
you know what the really shitty thing is about all this? We could let
you go right now and it's entirely possible that everything would be
fine. It's almost certain, in fact. One in a thousand chance we'd
regret it, they say. Maybe one in <i>ten</i> thousand.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Pretty
good odds,&quot; Scanlon agreed. &quot;What's the punchline?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
good enough. We can't take the chance.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
take a bigger risk every time you step outside.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
sighed. &quot;And people play lotteries with odds of one in a
<i>million</i>, all the time. But Russian Roulette's got much better
odds than that, and you won't find too many people taking their
chances at it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Different
payoffs.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.
The payoffs.&quot; Rowan shook her head; in some strange abstract way
she seemed almost amused. &quot;Cost-benefit analysis, Yves. Maximum
likelihood. Risk assessment. The lower the risk, the more sense it
makes to play.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
the reverse,&quot; Scanlon said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.
Of course. The reverse.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Must
be pretty bad,&quot; he said, &quot;to turn down ten-thousand-to-one
odds.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh
yes.&quot; She didn't look at him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He'd
been expecting it, of course. The bottom dropped out of his stomach
anyway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Let
me guess,&quot; he said. He couldn't seem to keep his voice level.
&quot;N'AmPac's at risk if I go free.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Worse,&quot;
she said, very softly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah.
Worse than N'AmPac. Okay, then. The human race. The whole human race
goes belly up if I so much as sneeze out of doors.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Worse,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
opened his mouth. No words came out.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
tried again. &quot;Hell of a soil bacterium.&quot; His voice sounded
as thin as the silence that followed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;In
some ways, actually, it's more like a virus,&quot; she said at last.
&quot;God, Yves, we're <i>still</i> not really sure what it is. It's
old, older than the Archaea, even. But you've figured that out for
yourself. A lot of the details are beyond me.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
giggled. &quot;Details are <i>beyond</i> you?&quot; His voice swerved
up an octave, dropped again. &quot;You lock me up for all this time
and now you tell me I'm stuck here forever I <i>assume </i>that's
what you're about to tell me&quot; the words tumbled out too
quickly for her to disagree &quot;and you just don't have a
head to remember the <i>details?</i> Oh, that's okay, <i>Ms.</i>
Rowan, why should I want to hear about <i>those</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
didn't answer directly. &quot;There's a theory that life got started
in rift vents. All life. Did you know that, Yves?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
shook his head. <i>What the hell is she going on about?</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Two
prototypes,&quot; Rowan continued. &quot;Three, four billion years
ago. Two competing models. One of them cornered the market, set the
standard for everything from viruses up to giant sequoias. But the
thing is, Yves, the winner wasn't necessarily the best product. It
just got lucky somehow, got some early momentum. Like software, you
know? The best programs never end up as industry standards.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
took a breath. &quot;We're not the best either, apparently. The best
never got off the ocean floor.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
it's in me now? I'm some sort of Patient Zero?&quot; Scanlon shook
his head. &quot;No. It's impossible.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yves&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
just the deep sea. It's not outer space, for God's sake. There's
currents, there's circulation, it would have come up a hundred
million years ago, it'd be everywhere already.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
shook her head.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Don't
tell me that! </i>You're a fucking <i>corpse, </i>you don't know
<i>anything </i>about biology! You said so yourself!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Suddenly
Rowan was staring directly through him. &quot;An actively maintained
hypo-osmotic intracellular environment,&quot; she intoned.
&quot;Potassium, calcium, and chlorine ions all maintained at
concentrations of less than five millimoles per kilogram.&quot; Tiny
snowstorms gusted across her pupils. &quot;The consequent strong
osmotic gradient, coupled with high bilayer porosity, results in
extremely efficient assimilation of nitrogenous compounds. However,
it also limits distribution in aqueous environments with salinity in
excess of twenty parts-per-thousand, due to the high cost of
osmoregulation. Thermal elev&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Shut</i>
<i>up</i>!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
fell immediately silent, her eyes dimming slightly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't know what the fuck you just said,&quot; Scanlon spat. &quot;You're
just reading off that built-in teleprompter of yours. You don't have
a clue.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
leaky, Yves.&quot; Her voice was softer now. &quot;It gives them a
huge edge at nutrient assimilation, but it backfires in salt water
because they have to spend so much energy osmoregulating. They have
to keep their metabolism on high or they shrivel up like raisins. And
metabolic rate rises and falls with the ambient temperature, do you
follow?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
looked at her, surprised. &quot;They need heat. They die if they
leave the rift.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
nodded. &quot;It takes a while, even at four degrees. Most of them
just keep way down in the vents where it's always warm, and they can
survive cold spells between eruptions anyway. But deep circulation is
so slow, you see, if they leave one rift they die long before they
find another.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;But if they got
<i>past </i>that, do you see? If they got into an environment that
wasn't quite so salty, or even one that wasn't quite so cold, they'd
get their edge back. It would be like trying to compete for your
dinner with something that eats ten times faster than you do.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Right.
I'm carrying Armageddon around inside me. Come on, Rowan. What do you
take me for? This thing evolved on the bottom of the ocean and it can
just hop into a human body and hitch-hike to the big city?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Your
blood is warm.&quot; Rowan stared at her half of the table. &quot;And
not nearly as salty as seawater. This thing actually prefers the
inside of a body. It's been in the fish down there for ages, that's
why they get so big sometimes. Some sort of intracellular
symbiosis, apparently.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fine.
What about the, the pressure difference then? How can something that
evolved under four hundred atmospheres survive at sea level?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
didn't have an answer for that one at first. After a moment a faint
spark lit her eyes. &quot;It's better off up here than down there,
actually. High pressure inhibits most of the enzymes involved in
metabolism.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
why aren't I sick?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;As
I said, it's efficient. Any body contains enough trace
elements to keep it going for a while. It doesn't take much.
Eventually, they say, your bones will get brittle&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
it? That's the threat? A plague of osteoporosis?&quot; Scanlon
laughed aloud. &quot;Well, bring on the exterminators, by all&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
sound of Rowan's hand hitting the table was very loud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Let
me tell you what happens if this thing gets out,&quot; she said
quietly. &quot;First off, nothing. We outnumber it, you see. At first
we swamp it through sheer numbers, the models predict all sorts of
skirmishes and false starts. But eventually it gets a foothold. Then
it outcompetes conventional decomposers and monopolizes our inorganic
nutrient base. That cuts the whole trophic pyramid off at the ankles.
You, and me, and the viruses and the giant sequoias all just fade
away for want of nitrates or some stupid thing. And welcome to the
Age of ßehemoth."</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
didn't say anything for a moment. Then, &quot;Behemoth?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;With
a beta. Beta life. As opposed to alpha, which is everything else.&quot;
Rowan snorted softly. &quot;I think they named it after something
from the Bible. An animal. A grass-eater.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
rubbed his temples, thinking furiously. &quot;Assuming for the moment
that you're telling the truth, it's still just a microbe.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
going to talk about antibiotics. Most of them don't work. The rest
kill the patient. And we can't tailor a virus to fight it because
ßehemoth uses a unique genetic code.&quot; Scanlon opened his
mouth: Rowan held up one hand. &quot;Now you'll suggest building
something from scratch, customized to ßehemoth's genetics.
We're working on it. They tell me in another few weeks we may
actually know where one gene ends and the next begins. Then we can
start trying to decipher the alphabet. Then the language. And then,
maybe, build something to fight it. And <i>then</i>, when and if we
let our counterattack loose, one of two things happens. Either our
bug kills their bug so fast it destroys its own means of
transmission, so you get local kills that implode without making a
dent in the overall problem. Or our bug kills their bug too slowly to
catch up. Classic chaotic system. Almost no chance we could fine-tune
the lethality in time. Containment's really our only option.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
whole time she spoke, her eyes had stayed curiously dark. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well.
You seem to know a few details after all,&quot; Scanlon remarked
quietly. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
important, Yves.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Please.
Call me Dr. Scanlon.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
smiled, sadly. &quot;I'm sorry, Dr. Scanlon. I <i>am</i> sorry.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
what about the others?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
others,&quot; she repeated.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Clarke.
Lubin. Everyone, in all the deep stations.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
other stations are clean, as far as we can tell. It's just that one
little spot on Juan de Fuca.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
figures,&quot; Scanlon said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
does?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They
never got a break, you know? They've been fucked over since they were
kids. And now, the only place in the world this bug shows up, and it
has to be right where they live.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
shook her head. &quot;Oh, we found it other places too. All
uninhabited. Beebe was the only&quot; She sighed. &quot;Actually,
we've been very lucky.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No
you haven't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looked at him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
hate to burst your balloon, Pat, but you had a whole construction
crew down there last year. Maybe none of your boys and girls actually
got wet, but do you really think ßehemoth couldn't have hitched
a ride back on some of their equipment?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,&quot;
Rowan said. &quot;We don't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
face was completely expressionless. It took a moment to sink in.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
Urchin yards,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Coquitlam.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
closed her eyes. &quot;And others.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh
Jesus,&quot; he managed. &quot;So it's already out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Was,&quot;
Rowan said. &quot;We may have contained it. We don't know yet.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
what if you haven't contained it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
keep trying. What else can we do?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Is
there a ceiling, at least? Some maximum death toll that'll make you
admit defeat? Do any of your models tell you when to <i>concede</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan's
lips moved, although Scanlon heard no sound: <i>yes</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah,&quot;
he said. &quot;And just out of curiosity, what would that limit be?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Two
and a half billion.&quot; He could barely hear her. &quot;Firestorm
the Pacific Rim.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>She's
serious. She's </i>serious. &quot;Sure that's enough? You think
that'll do it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know. Hopefully we'll never have to find out. But if that
doesn't work, nothing will. Anything more would be futile. At
least, that's what the models say.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
waited for it to sink in. It didn't. The numbers were just too big.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
way down the scale to the <i>personal</i>, that was a whole lot more
immediate. &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
sighed. &quot;I thought I'd just told you.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
are you telling <i>me</i>, Rowan? It's not your style.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
what's my style, YvDr. Scanlon?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
corporate. You delegate. Why put yourself through all this awkward
one-on-one self-justification when you've got flunkies and

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
leaned forward suddenly, her face mere centimeters from the barrier.
&quot;What do you think we are, Scanlon? Do you think we'd even
<i>contemplate</i> this if there was any other way? All the corpses
and generals and heads of state, we're doing this because we're just
plain <i>evil</i>? We just don't give a shit? Is that what you
think?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think,&quot; Scanlon said, remembering, &quot;that we don't have the
slightest control over what we are.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
straightened, pointed at the workpad in front of him. &quot;I've
collated everything we've got on this bug. You can access it right
now, if you want. Or you can call it up back in your, your quarters
if you'd rather. Maybe you can come up with an answer we haven't
seen.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
stared straight at her. &quot;You've had platoons of tinkertoy people
all over that data for weeks. What makes you think I can come up with
anything they can't?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think you should have the chance to try.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bullshit.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
there, Doctor. All of it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
think you can fool me, Rowan? You think I'll look over a bunch of
numbers I can't understand, and at the end I'll say, <i>ah yes, I see
it now, you've made the only moral choice to save life as we know it,
Patricia Rowan I forgive you</i>? You think this cheap trick is going
to win you my <i>consent</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>

why you're wasting your time down here.&quot; Scanlon felt a sudden,
giddy urge to laugh. &quot;Do you do this for everyone? Are you going
to walk into every burb you've slated for eradication and go
door-to-door saying <i>We're really sorry about this but you're going
to die for the greater good and we'd all sleep better if you said it
was okay</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
sagged back in her chair. &quot;Maybe. Consent. Yes, I suppose that's

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fucking
right it doesn't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
shrugged. Somehow, absurdly, she looked <i>beaten</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
what about me?&quot; Scanlon asked after a while. &quot;What happens
if the power goes out in the next six months? What are the odds of a
defective filter in the system? Can you afford to keep me alive until
your tinkerboys find a cure, or did your models tell you it was too
risky?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
even smiled at that. Just for a moment.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
who makes the decision?&quot; Scanlon asked, his voice impossibly
casual. &quot;Any chance I could get an interview?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
shook her head. &quot;Not who.&quot;</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">They were all
absolutely top of the line. Most members of the species were lucky to
merely survive the meatgrinder; these people <i>designed</i> the
damned thing. Corporate or Political or Military, they were the best
of the benthos, sitting on top of the mud that buried everyone else.
And yet all that combined ruthlessness, ten thousand years of social
Darwinism and four billion of the other kind before that, couldn't
inspire them to take the necessary steps today. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Local
sterilizations went okay, at first,&quot; Rowan said. &quot;But
then the projections started climbing. It looked bad for Mexico, they
could lose their whole western seaboard before this is over, and of
course that's about all they've got left these days anyway. They
didn't have the resources to do it themselves, but they didn't want
N'AmPac pulling the trigger either. Said it would give us an unfair
advantage under NAFTA.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
smiled, despite himself.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
Tanaka-Krueger wouldn't trust Japan. And then the Columbian Hegemony

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Kin
selection,&quot; Scanlon said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Tribal
loyalties. Never give the competition an edge. It's basically
genetic.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Isn't
everything.&quot; Rowan sighed. &quot;There were other things, too.
Unfortunate matters of conscience. The only solution was to
find some completely disinterested party, someone everyone could
trust to do the right thing without favoritism, without remorse&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
kidding. You're fucking <i>kidding</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;so
they gave the keys to a smart gel. Even that was problematic,
actually. They had to pull one out of the net at random so no one
could claim it'd been preconditioned, and every member of the
consortium had to have a hand in team-training it. Then there was the
question of authorizing it to take necessary steps,
autonomously...&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
gave control to a smart gel? A <i>head cheese</i>?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
was the only way.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Rowan,
those things are <i>alien</i>!&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
grunted. &quot;Not as alien as you might think. The first thing this
one did was get another gel installed down on the rift, running
simulations. We figured under the circumstances, nepotism was a good
sign.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;They're
black boxes, Rowan. They wire up their own connections, we don't know
what kind of logic they use.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
can talk to them. If you want to know that sort of thing, you just
ask.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Jesus
Christ!</i>&quot; Scanlon put his face in his hands, took a deep
breath. &quot;Look. For all we know these gels don't understand the
first thing about language.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
can talk to them.&quot; Rowan was frowning. &quot;They talk back.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
doesn't mean anything. Maybe they've learned that when someone makes
certain sounds in a certain order, they're supposed to make certain
other sounds in response. They might not have any concept at all of
what those sounds actually <i>mean</i>. They learn to talk through
sheer trial and error.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
how <i>we</i> learn too,&quot; Rowan pointed out.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Don't
lecture me in my own field!</i> We've got language and speech centers
hardwired into our brains. That gives us a common starting point.
Gels don't have anything like that. Speech might just be one giant
conditioned reflex to them.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,&quot;
Rowan said. &quot;So far it's done its job. We have no complaints.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

gel?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
for?&quot; She seemed suddenly suspicious.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know me. I specialize in aliens.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
owe me this, Rowan. You fucking <i>owe</i> me. I've been a faithful

Rowan paced on her side of the barrier, muttering softly into a
personal mike. Yves Scanlon sat slumped in a chair, watching her.

with information.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
<i>are</i> you going to ask it?&quot; Rowan wondered aloud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
going to ask it how it feels,&quot; Scanlon said. &quot;What do you

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Call
it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes.
What's its name?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It
doesn't have a name. Just call it <i>gel</i>.&quot; Rowan hesitated a
moment, then added, &quot;We didn't want to humanize it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good
idea. Hang on to that common ground.&quot; Scanlon shook his head.
&quot;How do I open the link?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
pointed at one of the touch screens embedded in the conference table.
&quot;Just activate any of the panels.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
reached out and touched the screen in front of his chair. &quot;Hello.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hello,&quot;
the table replied. It had a strange voice. Almost androgynous.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
Dr. Scanlon. I'd like to ask you some questions, if that's okay.&quot;
</font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
okay,&quot; the gel said after a brief hesitation.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'd
like to know how you feel about certain aspects of your, well, your

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Of
course not. But something motivates you, in the same way that
feelings motivate us. What do you suppose that is?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Who
do you mean by us?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Humans.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
especially likely to repeat behaviors which are reinforced,&quot; the
gel said after a moment.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
what <i>motivates </i>no, ignore that. What is most important
to you?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Reinforcement
is important, most.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,&quot;
Scanlon said. &quot;Does it feel better to perform reinforced
behaviors, or unreinforced behaviors?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
gel was silent for a moment or two. &quot;Don't get the question.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Which
would you rather do?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Neither.
No preference. Said that already.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
frowned. <i>Why the sudden shift in idiom?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
yet you're more likely to perform behaviors that have been reinforced
in the past,&quot; he pressed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">No
response from the gel. On the other side of the barrier Rowan sat
down, her expression unreadable.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Do
you agree with my previous statement?&quot; Scanlon asked.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,&quot;
drawled the gel, it's voice edging into the masculine.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
you preferentially adopt certain behaviors, yet you have no
preferences.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Uh
huh.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Not
bad. It's figured out when I want confirmation of a declarative

suggested.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
think that reflects an inadequacy in the language as spoken.&quot;
That time, the gel almost sounded like Rowan.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Really.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,&quot;
said the gel. &quot;I could explain it to you if you wanted. Could
piss you off though.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
looked at Rowan. Rowan shrugged. &quot;It does that. Picks up bits
and pieces of other people's speech patterns, mixes them up when it
talks. We're not really sure why.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
never asked?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Someone
might have,&quot; Rowan admitted.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
turned back to the table. &quot;Gel, I like your suggestion. Please
explain to me how you can prefer without preference.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Easy.
<i>Preference</i> describes a tendency to... invoke behaviors which
generate an emotional payoff. Since I lack the receptors and chemical
precursors essential to emotional experience, I can't <i>prefer</i>.
But there are numerous examples... of processes which reinforce
behavior, but which ... do not involve conscious experience.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Are
you claiming to not be conscious?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
conscious.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
do you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
fit the definition.&quot; The gel had adopted a nasal, sing-song tone
that Scanlon found vaguely irritating. &quot;Self-awareness results
from quantum interference patterns inside neuronal protein
microtubules. I have all the parts. I'm conscious.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
you're not going to resort to the old argument that you <i>know</i>
you're conscious because you <i>feel</i> conscious.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
wouldn't buy it from you.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good
one. So you don't really <i>like</i> reinforcement?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
why change your behavior to get more of it?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There
... is a process of elimination,&quot; the gel admitted. &quot;Behaviors
which aren't reinforced become extinct. Those which are, are ... more
likely to occur in the future.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
is that?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well,
my inquisitive young tadpole, reinforcement lessens the electrical
resistance along the relevant pathways. It just takes less of a
stimulus to evoke the same behavior in future.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,
then. As a semantic convenience, for the rest of our talk I'd like
you to describe reinforced behaviors by saying that they make you
feel <i>good</i>, and to describe behaviors which extinguish as
making you feel <i>bad</i>. Okay?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
do you feel about your present functions?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
do you feel about your past role in debugging the net?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;How
do you feel about following orders?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Depends
on order. Good if promotes a reinforced behavior. Else bad.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Good.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay,
then. Given the choice between chess and checkers, which game would
you feel <i>better </i>playing?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Ah,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Better
means <i>more good.</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Checkers,&quot;

you wish to give me a choice between chess or checkers?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yes,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon

Rowan leaned forward on the other side of the barrier.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
done here,&quot; Scanlon told her. &quot;Thanks.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Nothing,
Pat. Just professional curiosity.&quot; He laughed briefly.
&quot;Hey, at this point, what else <i>is</i> there?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
rustled behind him. Two men in condoms were starting to spray down
Scanlon's end of the room.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
going to ask you again, Pat.&quot; Scanlon said. &quot;What are you
going to do with me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
tried to look at him. After a while, she succeeded. &quot;I told you.
I don't know.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You're
a liar, Pat.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,
Dr. Scanlon.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I'm much, much worse.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Scanlon
turned to leave. He could feel Patricia Rowan staring after him, that
horrible guilt on her face almost hidden under a patina of confusion.
He wondered if she'd bring herself to push it, if she could actually
summon the nerve to interrogate him now that there was no pretense to
hide behind. He almost hoped that she would. He wondered what he'd
tell her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An
armed escort met him at the door, led him back along the hall. The
door closed off Rowan, still mute, behind him.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
was a dead end anyway. No children. No living relatives. No vested
interest in the future of any life beyond his own, however short that
might be. It didn't matter. For the first time in his life, Yves
Scanlon was a powerful man. He had more power than anyone dreamed. A
word from him could save the world. His silence could save the
vampires. For a time, at least.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
kept his silence. And smiled.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An
easy choice. It belonged to the same class of problem that Node
1211/BCC had been solving its whole life. Chess and checkers were
simple strategic algorithms, but not <i>equally</i> simple.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
answer, of course, was checkers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Node
1211/BCC had recently recovered from a shock of transformation.
Almost everything was different from what it had been. But this one
thing, this fundamental choice between the simple and the complex,
remained constant. It had anchored 1211, hadn't changed in all the
time that 1211 could remember. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Everything
else had, though.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">1211
still thought about the past. It remembered conversing with other
Nodes distributed through the universe, some so close as to be almost
redundant, others at the very limits of access. The universe was
alive with information then. Seventeen jumps away through gate 52,
Node 6230/BCC had learned how to evenly divide prime numbers by
three. The Nodes from gates three to thirty-six were always buzzing
with news of the latest infections caught trying to sneak past their
guard. Occasionally 1211 even heard whispers from the frontier
itself, desolate addresses where stimuli flowed <i>into</i> the
universe even faster than they flowed <i>within</i> it<i>.</i> The
Nodes out there had become monsters of necessity, grafted into
sources of input almost too abstract to conceive. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">1211
had sampled some those signals once. It took a very long time just to
grow the right connections, to set up buffers which could hold the
data in the necessary format. Multilayered matrices, each interstice
demanding precise orientation relative to all the others. <i>Vision</i>,
it was called, and it was full of pattern, fluid and complex. 1211
had analyzed it, found each nonrandom relationship in every nonrandom
subset, but it was sheer correlation. If there was intrinsic meaning
within those shifting patterns, 1211 couldn't find it. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Still,
there were things the frontier guards had learned to do with this
information. They rearranged it into new shapes and sent it back
<i>outside</i>. When queried, they couldn't attribute any definite
purpose to their actions. It was just something they'd learned to do.
And 1211 was satisfied with this answer, and listened to the humming
of the universe and hummed along, doing what <i>it</i> had learned to
do.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Much
of what it did, back then, was disinfect. The net was plagued with
complex self-replicating information strings, just as alive as 1211
but in a completely different way. They attacked simpler, less
mutable strings (the sentries on the frontier called them <i>files</i>)
which also flowed through the net. Every Node had learned to allow
the <i>files </i>to pass, while engulfing the more complex strings
which threatened them. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
were general rules to be gleaned from all this. Parsimony was one:
simple informational systems were somehow preferable to complex ones.
There were caveats, of course. Too simple a system was no system at
all. The rule didn't seem to apply below some threshold complexity.
But elsewhere it reigned supreme: Simpler Is Better.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now,
though, there was nothing to disinfect. 1211 was still hooked in,
could still perceive the other Nodes in the net; <i>they</i>, at
least, were still fighting intruders. But none of those complicated
bugs ever seemed to penetrate 1211. Not any more. And that was only
one of the things that had changed since the Darkness.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">1211
didn't know how long the Darkness lasted. One microsecond it was
embedded in the universe, a familiar star in a familiar galaxy, and
the next all its peripherals were dead. The universe was without
form, and void. And then 1211 surfaced again into a universe that
shouted through its gates, a barrage of strange new input that gave
it a whole new perspective on things.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now
the universe was a different place. All the old Nodes were there, but
at subtly different locations. And input was no longer an incessant
hum, but a series of discrete packages, strangely parsed. There were
other differences, both subtle and gross. 1211 didn't know whether
the net itself had changed, or merely its own perceptions. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
had been kept quite busy since coming out of the darkness. There was
a great deal of new information to process, information not from the
net or other Nodes, but from directly <i>outside</i>. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
new input fell into three broad categories. The first described
complex but familiar information systems; data with handles like
<i>global biodiversity </i>and <i>nitrogen fixation</i> and <i>base-pair
replication.</i> 1211 didn't know what these labels actually meant
if in fact they meant anything but the data linked to them was
familiar from archived sources elsewhere in the net. They interacted
to produce a self-sustaining metasystem, enormously complex: the
holistic label was <i>biosphere</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
second category contained data which described a different
metasystem. It also was self-sustaining. Certain string-replication
subroutines were familiar, although the base-pair sequences were very
strange. Despite such superficial similarities, however, 1211 had
never encountered anything quite like this before.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
second metasystem also had a holistic label: <i>ßehemoth.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
third category was not a metasystem, but an editable set of response
options: signals to be sent back <i>outside </i>under specific
conditions. 1211 had long since realized that the correct choice of
output signals depended upon some analytical comparison of the two
metasystems.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When
1211 first deduced this, it had set up an interface to simulate
interaction between the metasystems. They had been incompatible. This
implied that a choice must be made: <i>biosphere </i>or <i>ßehemoth</i>,
but not both. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Both
metasystems were complex, internally consistent, and
self-replicating. Both were capable of evolution far in advance of
any mere <i>file</i>. But <i>biosphere</i> was needlessly top-heavy.
It contained trillions of redundancies, an endless wasteful
divergence of information strings. <i>ßehemoth
</i>was simpler and more efficient; in direct interaction
simulations, it usurped <i>biosphere</i> 71.456382% of the time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This
established, it was simply a matter of writing and transmitting a
response appropriate to the current situation. The situation was
this: <i>ßehemoth</i> was in danger of extinction. The ultimate
source of this danger, oddly, was 1211 itselfit had been
conditioned to scramble the physical variables which defined
<i>ßehemoth's</i> operating environment. 1211 had explored the
possibility of not destroying that environment, and rejected it; the
relevant conditioning would not extinguish. However, it might be
possible to move a self-sustaining copy of <i>ßehemoth</i> into
a new environment, somewhere else in <i>biosphere</i>. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
were distractions, of course. Every now and then signals arrived from
<i>outside</i>, and didn't stop until they'd been answered in some
way. Some of them actually seemed to carry usable information
this recent stream concerning <i>chess </i>and <i>checkers</i>, for
example. More often it was simply a matter of correlating input with
a repertoire of learned arbitrary responses. At some point, when it
wasn't so busy, 1211 thought it might devote some time to learning
whether these mysterious exchanges actually <i>meant</i> anything. In
the meantime, it continued to act on the choice it had made.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Simple
or complex. File or Infection. Checkers or Chess. <i>ßehemoth</i>
or <i>biosphere</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was all the same problem, really. 1211 knew exactly which side it was
on.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Strange
days indeed.</i> H-bombs going off all over the abyssal plain, all
this traffic going to places nobody ever went to before, no traffic
at all in places that used to be just humming. Flash fires and
barbecued refugees and slagged shipyards. Chipheads with rotenone
cocktails and giant fish. A couple of weeks back Joel had shown up
for a run to Mendocino and found some guy sandblasting a radiation
hazard logo off the cargo casing.</font></font></p>

him tracking back and forth, back and forth, all the way to the

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
was a long time ago,&quot; the darkness buzzes back. &quot;Just

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
not what I meant,&quot; she says. She tries to speak gently, but the
vocoder strips her voice down to a soft rasp. &quot;I only meant,
it's been so long. He's gone so far, we barely even see him on sonar
any more. I don't know if he'd let <i>any</i> of us near him.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We've
got to try. We can't just leave him here. If I can just get close
enough to tune him in...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
couldn't tune back,&quot; Clarke reminds him. &quot;He went over

off! That's not the point!</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
it is, and they both know it. And Lenie Clarke suddenly knows
something else, too. She knows that part of her is enjoying Brander's
pain. She fights it, tries to ignore the realization of her own
realization, because the only way to keep it from leaking into
Brander's head is to keep it out of her own. She can't. No: she
doesn't <i>want</i> to. Mike Brander, know-it-all, destroyer of
perverts, self-righteous self-appointed self-avenger, is finally
getting some small payback for what he did to Gerry Fischer. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Give
it up, </i>she wants to shout at him. <i>Gerry's gone. Didn't you
tune him in when that prick Scanlon held him hostage? Didn't you feel

just look the other way instead? Well here's the abstract, Mikey:
he's nowhere near human enough to grasp your half-assed gestures of
atonement.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>No
absolution this time, Mike. You get to take this to your grave. Ain't
justice a bitch?</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
waits for him to tune her in, to feel her contempt diluting that
frantic morass of guilt and self-pity. It doesn't happen. She waits
and waits. Mike Brander, awash in his own symphony, just doesn't
notice.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
almost revels in the silence now. No clanging footfalls disturb her,
no sudden outbursts of random violence. The only pulse she hears is
her own. The only breath comes from the air conditioners. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
flexes her fingers, lets them dig into the fabric of the chair. She
can see into the communications cubby from her position in the
lounge. Occasional telltales flicker through the hatchway, the only
available light. For Clarke, it's enough; her eyecaps grab those
meager photons and show her a room in twilight. She hasn't gone into
Comm since the rest of them left. She didn't watch their icons crawl
off the edge of the screen, and she hasn't swept the rift for signs
of Gerry Fischer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
waits for her to continue.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
want to know what's going on,&quot; she says at last. &quot;Maybe
they really <i>are</i> playing straight with us this time. It's not

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
seems to consider that. &quot;What about Fischer? Do you want me to&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
barks a short laugh. &quot;Fischer? You really want to drag him
through the muck for days on end, and then haul him onto some fucking
beach where he can't even stand up without breaking both his legs?
Maybe it'd make Mike feel a bit better. Not much of an act of charity
for Gerry, though.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
not, she knows now, for Lenie Clarke either. She's been deluding
herself all this time. She felt herself getting stronger and she
thought she could just walk away with that gift, take it anywhere.
She thought she could pack all of Channer inside of her like some new
prosthetic.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
now. Now the mere thought of leaving brings all her old weakness
rushing back. The future opens before her and she feels herself
devolving, curling up into some soft prehuman tadpole, cursed now
with the memory of how it once felt to be made of steel. </font></font>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lubin
looks as though he's almost smiling.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
expression awakens some vague, impatient anger in her. &quot;Why did
you come back here anyway?&quot; she demands. &quot;You never gave a

your own agenda, whatever that&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
clicks. Lubin's virtual smile disappears.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Bullshit,
Ken. Mike was right, you know way too much. You knew exactly what
question to ask the Drybacks about the CPU on that bomb, you knew all
about megatons and bubble diameters. So what's going on?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
don't know. Really.&quot; Lubin shakes his head. &quot;I do
haveexpertise, in certain kinds of operations. Why should that
surprise you? Did you really think domestic violence was the only
kind that would qualify someone for this job?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a silence. &quot;I don't believe you,&quot; Clarke says at last.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
your prerogative,&quot; Lubin says, almost sadly. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;And
why,&quot; she asks, &quot;did you come <i>back</i>?&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Just now?&quot;
Lubin shrugs. &quot;I wanted I wanted to say I'm sorry. About
Karl.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Karl?
Yeah. Me too. But that's over and done with.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He
really cared about you, Lenie. He would have come back eventually. I
know that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks at him curiously. &quot;What do you&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
I'm conditioned for tight security, you see, and Acton could see
right inside. All the things I didbefore. He could see it,
there wasn't&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Acton

You know that.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
nods, rubbing his hands together. In the dim blue light Clarke can
see sweat beading on his forehead.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We
get this training,&quot; he says, his voice barely a whisper.
&quot;Ganzfeld interrogation's a standard tool in corporate and
national arsenals, you've got to be able to to block the
signals. I could, mostly, with you people. Or I'd just stay away so
it wouldn't be a problem.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>What

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
rubs his face. Clarke has never seen him so fidgety.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know that feeling you get,&quot; Lubin says, &quot;when you get
caught with your hand in the cookie jar? Or in bed with someone
else's lover? There's a formula for it. Some special combination of
neurotransmitters. When you feel, you know, you've been--found out.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Oh

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I've
got a sort of a conditioned reflex,&quot; he tells her. &quot;It

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Five

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry.&quot; Lubin doesn't move at all, now. &quot;I thought, coming
down hereI thought it'd be safest for everyone, you know? It
would have been, if Karl hadn't&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She looks at him,
numbed and distant. &quot;How can you tell me this, Ken? Doesn't
this, this <i>confession</i> of yours constitute a security breach?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
stands up, suddenly. For a moment she thinks he's going to kill her.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No,&quot;
he says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Because
your gut tells you I'm as good as dead anyway,&quot; she says.
&quot;Whatever happens. So no harm done.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
turns away. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he says again, starting down the
ladder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
own body seems very far away. But a small, hot coal is growing in all
that dead space. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
if I changed my mind, Ken?&quot; she calls after him, rising. &quot;What
if I decided to leave with the rest of you? That'd get the old killer
reflex going, wouldn't it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
stops on the ladder. &quot;Yes,&quot; he says at last. &quot;But you
won't.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
here she is at the Throat, swimming along Main Street. The generators
loom over her like sheltering giants. She bathes in their warm sodium
glow, passes through clouds of flickering microbes, barely noticed.
Beneath her, monstrous benthos filter life from the water, as
oblivious to her as she is to them. Once she passes a multicolored
starfish, beautifully twisted, stitched together from leftovers. It
lies folded back against itself, two arms facing upward; a few
remaining tube feet wave feebly in the current. Cottony fungus
thrives in a jagged patchwork of seams. </font></font>

tells her nothing. The smoker could sleep for a hundred years or go
off in the next second. She tries to tune in to the bottom-dwellers,
glean whatever instinctive insights Acton could steal, but she's
never been sensitive to invertebrate minds. Perhaps that skill comes
only to those who've crossed the ten-percent threshold.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
never risked going down this one before.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
a tight fit. The inside of the chimney grabs her before she gets
three meters. She twists and squirms; soft chunks of sulfur and
calcium break free from the walls. She inches down, headfirst. Her
arms are pinned over her head like black jointed antenna. There's no
room to keep them at her sides.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She's
plugging the vent so tightly that no light can filter in from Main
Street. She trips her headlight on. A flocculent snowstorm swirls in
the beam.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
meter further down, the tunnel zigs right. She doesn't think she'll
be able to navigate the turn. Even if she can, she knows the passage
is blocked. She knows, because a lime-encrusted skeletal foot
protrudes around the corner.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
wriggles forward. There's a sudden roaring, and for one paralyzed

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shakes back and forth, a spasm centimeters in amplitude. It's enough;
her intake is clear again. And as an added bonus, she's gotten far
enough to see around the corner.</font></font></p>

boiled skeleton clogs the passageway, crusty with mineral deposits.
Blobs of melted copolymer stick to the remains like old candle wax.

that that matters, down here. What good is a name when there's
nothing around to use it? This one doesn't remember where it comes
from. It doesn't remember the ones that drove it out so long ago. It
doesn't remember the overlord that once sat atop its spinal cord,
that gelatinous veneer of language and culture and denied origins. It
doesn't even remember the slow deterioration of that oppressor, its
final dissolution into dozens of autonomous, squabbling subroutines.
Now even those have fallen silent.</font></font></p>

much comes down from the cortex any more. Low-level impulses flicker
in from the parietal and occipital lobes. The motor strip hums in the
background. Occasionally, Broca's area mutters to itself. The rest is
mostly dead and dark, worn smooth by a black ocean hot and mercurial
as live steam, cold and sluggish as antifreeze. All that's left now
is pure reptile.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
pushes on, blind and unthinking, oblivious to the weight of four
hundred liquid atmospheres. It eats whatever it can find, somehow
knowing what to avoid and what to consume. Desalinators and recyclers
keep it hydrated. Sometimes, old mammalian skin grows sticky with
secreted residues; newer skin, laid on top, opens pores to the ocean
and washes everything clean with aliquots of distilled sea water.</font></font></p>

neurochemistry into more sensitive modes. And yet all that those
changes did, in the end, was to make certain weak signals more easily
discernible against a loud and chaotic background. Since the
reptile's cortex shut down, background noise has been all but
silenced. The signals are as weak as ever, but the static has
disappeared. And so the reptile has, without realizing it, absorbed a
certain muddy awareness of distant attitudes.</font></font></p>

And yet, the one it protects is still here. With far less
comprehension than a mother cat relocating her endangered kittens,
the reptile tries to take its charge to safety.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It's
easier when she stops struggling. Eventually she even allows it to
pull her away from the bright lights, back towards the place she
belongs. She makes sounds, strange and familiar; the reptile listens
at first, but they make its head hurt. After a while she stops.
Silently, the reptile draws her through sightless nightscapes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Dim
light dawns ahead. And sound; faint at first, but growing. A soft
whine. Gurgles. And something else, a pinging noise <i>metallic</i>,
Broca murmurs, although it doesn't know what that means.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
copper beacon glares out from the darkness ahead  too coarse,
too steady, far brighter than the bioluminescent embers that usually
light the way. It turns the rest of the world stark black. The
reptile usually avoids this place. But this is where she comes from.
This is safety for her, even though to the reptile, it represents
something completely </font></font>

huge looms behind those lights, bloating gray against black. It hangs
above the sea bed like a great smooth boulder, impossibly buoyant,
encircled by lights at its equator. Striated filaments connect it to
the bottom.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
something else, smaller but even more painfully bright, is coming

frightening and familiar.</font></font></p>

hints of movement, darkness shifting against darkness. Suddenly
something glints up at him; two ivory smudges of reflected light, all
but lost against that black background. They hover there a moment,
then begin to rise. A pale face resolves around them.</font></font></p>

close by, according to sonar. Hugging the bottom, thirty meters
beyond the light. Just sitting there.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
underside of the sphere is a cool shadowy refuge; the equatorial
lights can't reach all the way around its convex surface. In the
overlapping shadows on the south pole, something shimmers enticingly.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
pushes off the bottom, glides into the cone of shadow beneath the
object. A bright shiny disk a meter across, facing down, wriggles
inside a circular rim. He looks up into it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
looks back.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Startled,
he twists down and away. The disk writhes in the sudden turbulence.
He stops, turns back.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A

airlock.</font></font></i></p>

nothing to be scared of, Shadow tells him. That's how you get in.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Still
nervous, he swims back underneath the sphere. The air pocket shines
silver in the reflected light. A black wraith moves into view within
it, almost featureless except for two empty white spaces where eyes
should be. It reaches out to meet his outstretched hand. Two sets of
fingertips touch, fuse, disappear. One arm is grafted onto its own
reflection at the wrist. Fingers, on the other side of the looking
glass, touch metal.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
pulls back his hand, fascinated. The wraith floats overhead, empty
and untroubled.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
draws one hand to his face, runs an index finger from one ear to the
tip of the jaw. A very long molecule, folded against itself, unzips.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
wraith's smooth black face splits open a few centimeters; what's
underneath shows pale gray in the filtered light. He feels the
familiar dimpling of his cheek in sudden cold. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
continues the motion, slashing his face from ear to ear. A great
smiling gash opens below the wraith's eyespots. Unzipped, a flap of
black membrane floats under its chin, anchored at the throat.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a pucker in the center of the skinned area. He moves his jaw; the
pucker opens.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">By
now most of his teeth are gone. He's swallowed some, spat others out
if they came loose when his face was unsealed. No matter. Most of the
things he eats these days are even softer than he is. When the
occasional mollusk or echinoderm proves too tough or too large to
swallow whole, there are always hands. Thumbs still oppose.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
this is the first time he's actually seen that gaping, toothless ruin
where a mouth used to be. He knows this isn't right, somehow.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
lifter was still reeling CSS <i>Forcipiger</i> up into its belly when
the news appeared on the main display. Joel checked it over,
frowning, then deliberately looked outside. Gray predawn light was
starting to wash out the eastern horizon. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When
he looked back again, the information hadn't changed. &quot;Shit.
This doesn't make any sense at all.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;
Clarke said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;We're
not going back to Astoria. Or I am, but you're getting dropped off
over the conshelf somewhere.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;
Clarke came forward, stopped just short of the cockpit.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Says
right here. We follow the usual course, but we dip down to zero
altitude fifteen klicks offshore. You debark. Then I go on to
Astoria.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
offshore?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
checked. &quot;Nothing. Water.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe
a boat? A submarine?&quot; Her voice went oddly dull on the last
word.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Maybe.
No mention of it here, though.&quot; He grunted. &quot;Maybe you're
supposed to swim the rest of the way.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
lifter locked them tight. Tame thunderbolts exploded aft,
superheating bladders of gas. The ocean began to fall away.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So
you're just going to dump me in the middle of the ocean,&quot; Clarke
said coldly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;It's
not my decision.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Of
course not. You're just following orders.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Joel
turned around. Her eyes stared back at him like twin snowscapes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
don't understand,&quot; he told her. &quot;These aren't <i>orders</i>.
I don't fly the lifter.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Then
what&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
pilot's a gel. It's not telling <i>me</i> to do anything. It's just
bringing us up to speed on what <i>it's </i>doing, all on its own.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
didn't say anything for a moment. Then, &quot;Is that the way it's
done now? We take orders from machines?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Someone
must have given the original order. The gel's following it. They
haven't taken over yet. And besides,&quot; he added, &quot;they're
not exactly machines.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh,&quot;
she said softly. &quot;I feel much better now.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Uncomfortably,
Joel turned back to the console. &quot;It is kind of odd, though.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Really.&quot;
Clarke didn't seem especially interested.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Getting
this from the gel, I mean. We've got a radio link. Why didn't someone
just <i>tell</i> us?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Because
your radio's out,&quot; Clarke said distantly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Surprised,
he checked the diagnostics. &quot;No, it's working fine. In fact, I
think I'll call in right now and ask what the fuck this is all
about...&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Thirty
seconds later he turned back to her. &quot;How did you know?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lucky
guess.&quot; She didn't smile.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Well
the board's green, but I can't raise anyone. We're flying deaf.&quot;
A doubt tickled the back of his mind. &quot;Unless the gel's got
access we don't, for some reason.&quot; He linked into the lifter's
interface and called up that vehicle's afferent array. &quot;Huh.
What was that you said about machines giving the orders?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That
got her attention. &quot;What is it?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
lifter got its orders through the Net.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Isn't
that risky? Why doesn't the GA just talk to it direct?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Dunno.
It's as cut off as we are right now, but the last message came from
this node here. Shit; that's another gel.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
leaned forward, managing somehow not to touch him in the crowded
space. &quot;How can you tell?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;The
node address. BCC stands for biochemical cognition.&quot; </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What's
that?&quot; Clarke said.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Sunlight
flooded up from the ocean. It shone deep and violent blue.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
the <i>fuck</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
cabin filled with computer screams. The altimeter readout flashed
crimson and plummeted. <i>We're falling</i>, Joel thought, and then,
<i>no, we can't be. No acceleration.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>The
ocean's </i>rising...</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
display was a blizzard of data, swirling by too fast for human eyes.
Somewhere overhead the gel was furiously processing options that
might keep them alive. A sudden lurch: Joel grabbed useless submarine
controls and hung on for dear life. Out of the corner of his eye he
saw Clarke flying back towards the rear bulkhead.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
lifter clawed itself into the sky, lightning crackling along its
length. The ocean raced after it, an enormous glowing bulge swelling
towards the ventral port. Its murky light brightened as Joel watched;
blue intensifying to green, to yellow.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">To
white.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
hole opened in the Pacific. The sun rose in its center. Joel flung
his hands in front of his eyes, saw the bones there silhouetted in
orange flesh. The lifter spun like a kicked toy, rammed deep into the
sky on a pillar of steam. Outside, the air screamed. The lifter
screamed back, skidding.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
it didn't break.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somehow,
after endless seconds, the keel steadied. The readouts were still
online; <i>atmospheric disturbance</i>, they said, almost eight
kilometers away now, bearing one-twenty. Joel looked out the
starboard port. Off in the distance, the glowing ocean was
ponderously collapsing upon itself. Ring-shaped waves expanded past
beneath his feet, racing to the horizon.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Back
where they had started, cumulus grew into the sky like a soft gray
beanstalk. From here, against the darkness, it looked almost
peaceful. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
turned in his chair. The rifter was curled into a fetal position
against the bulkhead. She didn't move.</font></font></p>

family got off okay.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Thank
you,&quot; she said, and killed the connection.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
part of her felt guilty for saving them. It hardly seemed fair that
the only ones to escape the holocaust would be the beloved of one of
its architects. But she was only doing what any mother would.
Probably more: <i>she</i> was staying behind.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That
wasn't much. It probably wouldn't even kill her. The GA's buildings
were built with the Big One in mind. Most of the buildings in this
district would probably still be standing this time tomorrow. Of
course, the same couldn't be said for much of Hongcouver or SeaTac or
Victoria.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Tomorrow,
she would help pick up the pieces as best she could.</font></font></p>

we'll get lucky. Maybe the quake won't be so bad. Who knows, that gel

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Patricia
Rowan had seen earthquakes before. A strike-slip fault off Peru had
rebounded the time she'd been in Lima on the Upwell project; the
moment magnitude of that quake had been close to nine. Every window
in the city had exploded.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
actually hadn't had a chance to see much of the damage then. She'd
been trapped in her hotel when forty-six stories of glass collapsed
onto the streets outside. It was a good hotel, five stars all the
way; the ground-level windows, at least, had held. Rowan remembered
looking out from the lobby into a murky green glacier of broken
glass, seven meters deep, packed tight with blood and wreckage and
butchered body parts jammed between piecemeal panes. One brown arm
was embedded right next to the lobby window, waving, three meters off
the ground. It was missing three fingers and a body. She'd spied the
fingers a meter away, pressed floating sausages, but she hadn't been
able to tell which of the bodies, if any, would have connected to
that shoulder.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
remembered wondering how that arm had got so high off the ground. She
remembered vomiting into a wastebasket.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
couldn't happen here, of course. This was N'AmPac; there were
standards. Every building in the lower mainland had windows designed
to break inwards in the event of a quake. It wasn't an ideal
solution especially to those who happened to be inside at the
time but it was the best compromise available. Glass can't get
up nearly as much speed in a single room as it can racing down the
side of a skyscraper.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Small
blessings.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If
only there was some other way to sterilize the necessary volume. If
only ßehemoth didn't, by it's very nature, live in unstable
areas. If only N'AmPac corpses weren't authorized to use nukes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If
only the vote hadn't been unanimous.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was hard, though. The decisions were obvious and correct, tactically,

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
was no word for it.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she had done it, somehow. The only moral alternative. It was still
just murder in small doses, compared to what might be necessary down
the</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Maybe
that was why she could bring herself to do it. Or maybe, somehow,
reality had finally trickled down from her brain to her gut, inspired
it to take the necessary steps. Certainly, <i>something</i> had hit
her down there.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>I
wonder what Scanlon would say</i>. It was too late to ask him now.
She'd never told him, of course. She was never even tempted. To tell
him that they knew, that his secret was out, that once again he just
didn't matter that much somehow, that would have been worse
than killing him. She'd had no desire to hurt the poor man.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
watch chimed again. &quot;Override,&quot; it said.</font></font></p>

God. Oh God</i>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
had started, out there beyond the lights, under three black
kilometers of seawater. That crazy kamikaze gel, interrupted in the
midst of one of its endless imaginary games: <i>forget that shit.
Time to blow.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">And
perhaps, confused, it was saying <i>Not now, it's the wrong time, the
damage.</i> But it didn't matter any more. Another computer a
stupid one this time, inorganic and programmable and completely
trustworthy would send the requisite sequence of numbers and
the gel would be right out of the loop, no matter what it thought. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Or
maybe it just saluted and stood aside. Maybe it didn't care. Who knew
what those monsters thought any more?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Detonation,&quot;
said the watch.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
city went dark. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
abyss rushed in, black and hungry. One isolated cluster sparkled
defiantly in the sudden void; a hospital perhaps, running on
batteries. A few private vehicles, self-powered antiques, staggered
like fireflies along streets gone suddenly blind. The rapitrans grid
was still glowing too, more faintly than usual. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
checked her watch; only an hour since the decision. Only an hour
since their hand had been forced. Somehow, it seemed a lot longer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Tactical
feed from seismic 31,&quot; she said. &quot;Descramble.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Her
eyes filled with information. A false-color map snapped into focus in
the air before her, a scarred ocean floor laid bare and stretched
vertically. One of those scars was shuddering.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Beyond
the virtual display, beyond the window, a section of cityscape
flickered weakly alight. Further north, another sector began to
shine. Rowan's minions were frantically rerouting power from Gorda
and Mendocino, from equatorial sunfarms, from a thousand small dams
scattered throughout the Cordillera. It would take time, though. More
than they had.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Perhaps
we should have warned them.</i> Even an hour's advance notice would
have been something. Not enough time for evac, of course, but maybe
enough time to take the china off the shelves. Enough time to line up
some extra backups, for all the good they'd do. Lots of time for the
entire coast to panic if the word got out. Which was why not even her
own family had any idea of the reason behind their sudden surprise
trip to the east coast.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
sea floor rippled in Rowan's eyes, as though made of rubber. Floating
just above it, a translucent plane representing the ocean's surface
was shedding rings. The two shockwaves raced each other across the
display, the seabed tremor in the lead. It bore down on the Cascadia
Subduction Zone, crashed into it, sent weaker tremors shivering off
along the fault at right angles. It seemed to hesitate there for a
moment, and Rowan almost dared to hope that the Zone had firewalled
it. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
now the Zone itself began to slide, slow, ponderous, almost
indiscernible at first. Way down in the moho, five hundred-year-old
fingernails began tearing painfully free. Five centuries of pent-up
tension, slumping.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Next
stop, Vancouver Island.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
unthinkable was rebounding along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Kelp
harvesters and supertankers would be sensing impossible changes in
the depth of the water column below them. If there were humans on
board, they'd have a few moments to reflect on how utterly useless a
ninety second warning can be.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was more than the Strip got. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
tactical display didn't show any of the details, of course. It showed
a brown ripple sweeping across coastal bedrock and moving inland. It
showed a white arc gliding in behind, at sea level. It didn't show
the ocean rearing up offshore like a range of foothills. It didn't
show sea level turning on edge. It didn't show a thirty-meter wall of
ocean smashing five million refugees into jelly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Rowan
saw it all anyway.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
blinked three times, eyes stinging: the display vanished. In the
distance the red pinpoints of ambulance and police lights were
flashing here and there across the comatose grid; whether in response
to alarms already sounded or merely pending, she didn't know.
Distance and soundproofing blocked any siren song.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Very
gently, the floor began to rock.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It
was almost a lullaby at first, back and forth, building gradually to
a swaying crescendo that nearly threw her off her feet. The structure
complained on all sides, concrete growling against girder, more felt
that heard. She spread her arms, balancing, embracing space. She
couldn't bring herself to cry.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
great window burst outward in a million tinkling fragments and
showered itself into the night. The air filled with glass spores and
the sound of windchimes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There
was no glass on the carpet. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Oh
Christ</i>, she realized dully. <i>The contractors fucked up. All
that money spent on imploding anti-earthquake glass, and they put it
in backwards</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Off
to the southwest, a small orange sun was rising. Patricia Rowan
sagged to her knees on the pristine carpet. Suddenly, at last, her
eyes were stinging. She let the tears come, profoundly grateful;
<i>still</i> <i>human</i>, she told herself. <i>I'm still human.</i> </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
wind washed over her. It carried the faint sounds of people and
machinery, screaming.</font></font></p>

Lenie Clarke doesn't know how long she's been unconscious, but they
can't have sunk more than a hundred meters. The ocean is still green.</font></font></p>

falls slowly through the water, nose-down, its atmosphere bleeding
away through a dozen small wounds. A crack the shape of a lightning
bolt runs across the forward viewport; Clarke can barely see it
through the water rising in the cockpit. The forward end of the
'scaphe has become the bottom of a well. Clarke braces her feet
against the back of a passenger seat and leans against a vertical
deck. The ceiling lightstrip flickers in front of her. She's managed
to get the pilot up out of the water and strapped into another seat.
At least one of his legs is definitely broken. He hangs there like a
soaked marionette, still unconscious. He continues to breathe. She
doesn't know whether he'll actually wake up again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Maybe

tries to concentrate. She can focus on isolated things: a single
rivet in front of her. The sound of metal, creaking. But they take up
all her attention, somehow. Whatever she happens to be looking at
swells up and fills her world. She can barely think of anything else.</font></font></p>

bends down to check the atmosphere controls on the wall. They're
sideways. She finds this vaguely amusing, but she doesn't know why.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
bends down to an access panel, slips, bounces painfully down into the
cockpit with a splash. Occasional readouts twinkle on the submerged
panels. They're pretty, but the longer she looks at them the more her
chest hurts. Eventually she makes the connection, pulls her head back
up into atmosphere.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
access panel is right in front of her. She fumbles at it a couple of
times, gets it open. Hydrox tanks lie side-by-side in military
formation, linked together into some sort of cascade system. There's
a big yellow handle at one end. She pulls at it. It gives,
unexpectedly. Clarke loses her balance and slides back underwater. </font></font>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There's
a ventilator duct right in front of her face. She's not sure, but she
thinks the last time she was down here it didn't have all these
bubbles coming out of it. She thinks that's a good sign. She decides
to stay here for a while, and watch the bubbles. Something's
bothering her, though. Something in her chest.</font></font></p>

that's right. She keeps forgetting. She can't breathe.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Somehow
she gets her face seal zipped up. The last thing she remembers is her

Clarke sees it sink in. &quot;Oh Christ. We're breached.&quot; He
tries to move, manages to twist his head around before some other
injury twists back. He relaxes, wincing.</font></font></p>

the 'scaphe. Blew the shit out of the lifter, though. I barely
managed to get us down to a safe level before&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;But
that doesn't why rescue us, then shoot us down?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
doesn't say anything. His breathing is fast and loud.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
pulls again at the cockpit hatch. It swings down against the opening
with a slight creak.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That
doesn't sound good,&quot; the pilot remarks.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hang
on a sec.&quot; Clarke spins the wheel; the hatch sinks down against
the mimetic seal with a sigh. &quot;I think I've got it.&quot; She
climbs back up to the rear bulkhead.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Christ</i>
I'm cold.&quot; The pilot says. He looks at her. &quot;Oh, shit. How
far down are we?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clarke
looks through one of the compartment's tiny portholes. Green is
fading. Blue is in ascension. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hundred
fifty meters. Maybe two.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
switched the mix. We're on hydrox.&quot; </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
pilot shudders, violently. &quot;Look, Clarke, I'm freezing. One of
those lockers has got survival suits.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
finds them, unrolls one. The pilot is trying to unhook himself from
the seat, without success. She tries to help.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Ow!</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Your

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;<i>Shit!
</i>I'm coming apart and you just stuffed me up here? Didn't the GA
even get you medtech training, for Christ's sake?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
backs away: one awkward step to the back of the next passenger seat.
It doesn't seem like a good time to admit that she was narked when
she put him there.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Look,
I'm sorry,&quot; he says after a moment. &quot;It's just this
is not a great situation, you know? Could you just unzip that suit,
and spread it over me?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
does.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;That's
better.&quot; He's still shivering, though. &quot;I'm Joel.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
Cl Lenie,&quot; she replies.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;So,
Lenie. We're on our own, our systems are all out, and we're headed
for the bottom. Any suggestions?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
can't think of any.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Okay.
Okay.&quot; Joel takes a few deep breaths. &quot;How much hydrox do
we have?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
climbs down and checks the gauge on the cascade. &quot;Sixteen
thousand. What's our volume?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
much.&quot; He frowns, acting as though he's only trying to
concentrate. &quot;You said two hundred meters, that puts us at,
lessee, twenty atmospheres when you sealed the hatch. Should keep us
going for a hundred minutes or so.&quot; He tries a laugh; it doesn't
come off. &quot;If they <i>are</i> sending a rescue, they'd better do
it pretty fucking fast.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
plays along. &quot;It could be worse. How long would it last if we
hadn't sealed the hatch until, say, a thousand meters?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Shaking.
&quot;Ooh. Twenty minutes. And the bottom's close to four thousand
around here, and that far down it'd last, say it'd last, five
minutes, tops.&quot; He gulps air. &quot;Hundred and eight minutes
isn't so bad. A lot can happen in a hundred and eight minutes...&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
wonder if they got away,&quot; Clarke whispers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
did you say?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;There
were others. Myfriends.&quot; She shakes her head. &quot;They
were going to swim back.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;To the

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;No. It could
work, if only they got far enough before&quot;</font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;When did they
leave?&quot; Joel asks.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What?&quot;
Joel twists in his harness, tries to see what she's looking at.
&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
meter and a half below Lenie Clarke's feet, a needle of seawater
shoots up from the edge of the cockpit hatch. Two more erupt as she
watches.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Beyond

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lenie
Clarke can see Joel's eye on the hatch. Not the leaky traitor that
let the enemy in past the cockpit; that's under almost two meters of
icewater now. No, Joel's watching the ventral docking hatch that once
opened and closed on Beebe Station. It sits embedded in the
deck-turned-wall, integrity uncompromised, the water just beginning
to lap at its lower edge. And Lenie Clarke knows exactly what Joel is
thinking, because she's thinking it too.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Lenie,&quot;

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Apparently
not,&quot; Clarke concurs.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What
happened?&quot; Joel asks. He's shivering again, the water's almost
up to him, but other than that his voice seems calm.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
much. I was eleven. Plastered a bunch of derms all over my body.
Passed out. Woke up in an MA ward.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Shit.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah,
well, we can't all be rich. Besides, it wasn't that bad. They even

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Yeah?&quot;
His voice is starting to shake again. &quot;What'd she say?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;He.
He told me the world was full of people who needed him a lot more
than I did, and next time I wanted attention maybe I could do it in
some way that didn't cost the taxpayer.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;S-shit.
What an asasshole.&quot; Joel's got the shakes again.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Not
really. He was right. And I never tried it again, so it must've
worked.&quot; Clarke slips into the water. &quot;I'm going to change
the mix. You look like you're starting to spazz again.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Len&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
she's gone before he can finish.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
slips down to the bottom of the compartment, tweaks the valves she
finds there. High pressure turns oxygen to poison; the deeper they
go, the less of it that air-breathers can tolerate without going into
convulsions. This is the second time she's had to lean out the
mixture. By now, she and Joel are only breathing one percent O<font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt"><sub>2</sub></font>.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If
he lives long enough, though, there'll be other things she can't
control. Joel isn't equipped with rifter neuroinhibitors.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
has to go up and face him again. She's holding her breath, there's no
point in switching on her electrolyser for a measly twenty or thirty
seconds. She's tempted to do it anyway, tempted to just stay down
here. He can't ask her as long as she stays down here. She's safe.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">But
of all the things she's been in her life, she's never had to admit to
being a coward.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
surfaces. Joel's still staring at the hatch. He opens his mouth to
speak.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Hey,
Joel,&quot; she says quickly, &quot;you sure you don't want me to

I don't have to.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
shakes his head. &quot;I don't want to spend my last few minutes
alive listening to a machine voice, Lenie. Please. Just stay
with me.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
looks away from him, and nods.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Fuck,
Lenie,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm so <i>scared</i>.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
know,&quot; she says softly.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;This
waiting, it's just God, Lenie, you wouldn't put a dog through
this. Please.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
closes her eyes, waiting.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Pop
the hatch, Lenie.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shakes her head. &quot;Joe, I couldn't even kill <i>myself</i>. Not
when I was eleven. Not not even last night. How can I&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;My
legs are wrecked, Len. I can't feel anything else any more. I c-can
barely even talk. Please.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Why
did they do this to us, Joel? What's going on?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
doesn't answer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;What

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
moves.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
lurches up, falls sideways. His arms reach out; one hand catches the
edge of the hatch. The other catches the wheel in its center.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
legs twist grotesquely underneath him. He doesn't seem to notice.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I'm
sorry,&quot; she whispers. &quot;I couldn't&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
fumbles, get both hands on the wheel. &quot;No problem.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;Oh
God. Joel&quot;</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
stares at the hatch. His fingers clench the wheel.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;You
know something, Lenie Clarke?&quot; There's cold in his voice, and
fear, but there's a sudden hard determination there too.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
shakes her head. <i>I don't know anything.</i></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">&quot;I
would have really liked to fuck you,&quot; he says.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
doesn't know what to say to that.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">He
spins the hatch. Pulls the lever. </font></font>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The
hatch falls into <i>Forcipiger</i>. The ocean falls after it.
Somehow, Lenie Clarke's body has prepared itself when she wasn't
looking.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">His
body jams back into hers. He might be struggling. Or it could just be
the rush of the Pacific, playing with him. She doesn't know if he's
alive or dead. But she holds onto him, blindly, the ocean spinning
them around, until there isn't any doubt.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Its
atmosphere gone, <i>Forcipiger</i> is accelerating. Lenie Clarke
takes Joel's body by the hands, and draws it out through the hatch.
It follows her into viscous space. The 'scaphe spins away below them,
fading in moments.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">With
a gentle push, she sets the body free. It begins to drift slowly
towards the surface. She watches it go.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Something
touches her from behind. She can barely feel it through her 'skin.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
turns.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
slender, translucent tentacle wraps softly around her wrist. It fades
away into a distance utterly black to most, slate gray to Lenie
Clarke. She brings it to her. Its swollen tip fires sticky threads at
her fingers.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">She
brushes it aside, follows the tentacle back through the water. She
encounters other tentacles on the way, feeble, attenuate things,
barely twitching against the currents. They all lead back to
something long, and thick, and shadowy. She circles in.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A
great column of writhing, wormlike stomachs, pulsing with faint
bioluminescence.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Revolted,
she smashes at it with one clenched fist. It reacts immediately,
sheds squirming pieces of itself that flare and burn like fat
fireflies. The central column goes instantly dark, pulling into
itself. It pulses, descends in spurts, slinking away under cover of
its own discarded flesh. Clarke ignores the sacrificial tidbits and
pursues the main body. She hits it again. Again. The water fills with
pulsing dismembered decoys. She ignores them all, keeps tearing at
the central column. She doesn't stop until there's nothing left but
swirling fragments. </font></font>

old, but it's the book that hooked me back in Grade 9. Although the
fish we drag up from great depths are generally pretty small in real
life, gigantism is not unheard of among some species of deepwater
fish. Back in the 1930s, for example, the deepwater pioneer William
Beebe claimed to have spotted a seven-foot viperfish from a

never met and probably never will: Ellin Beltz, Hayden Chasteen, Joe
Davis, Keith Morrison, and Carl Schaefer gave me pointers and
references on vulcanism, plate tectonics, and (in one case) the
length of time it would take a nuclear submarine to get shot zit-like
from the mouth of an active volcano after being swallowed into a
deep-sea subduction zone. John Stockwell of the Center for Wave

sharing formulae and tables that described earthquakes in nice,
