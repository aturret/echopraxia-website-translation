				<p>These essays often take the form of rants, but they’re endearing and engaging ones. Watts, a former marine biologist and Hugo Award-winning Canadian science fiction writer, rails against climate change one moment and movingly describes his relationship with a cat the next. You never know where his writing’s going to lead, and reading his essays is an exciting, energizing, and occasionally bewildering journey.</p>

				In his novel <i>Tau Zero</i> (1970), Poul Anderson gave us the starship <i>Leonora Christine</i>, which through an accident to its Bussard ramscoop engines suffers a constant acceleration of one <i>g</i>, subjecting its crew to an increasingly vertiginous temporal dilation in which millions of years end up passing in seconds, all the way to the contraction of the Universe itself. Frederik Pohl and Jack Williamson's <i>The Singers of Time</i> (1991) likewise presents an extreme relativistic scenario. <i>The Freeze-Frame Revolution</i> operates in similar "high concept" ground, but it's undeniably the best of this breed, presenting engaging, believably flawed characters with complex interrelationships (and I certainly count Chimp among them) and a surprise ending that still manages to feel consistent with what has come before. Watts is an original thinker and a bold storyteller, here at the top of his considerable form. This is one of the year's best science fiction odysseys.

				If you ever doubted that the core of all good science fiction is still the human heart, here comes Peter Watts to ram the point home.  Freeze Frame Revolution is the purest driven high concept SF, told across scales of time and space to daunt all but the very finest Space Opera practitioners, and yet it remains as vivid and carnal and profane as the headiest of high-end literature.  Welcome to a dizzying window on desperate lives, lived out thousands of light years from home and further from us in time than the dinosaurs.  Watts is out for big game here, but he's come tooled up for the hunt.  Armour up your soul and keep the pace if you can!

				<em>Blindsight</em> does, among other things, what hard SF should aspire to but in fact so rarely achieves: demonstrate the literary value of a scientific worldview.  What impresses most about the book is the extent to which Watts follows through on the implications of [his] stance. Watts meets the challenge head-on: the visceral relentlessness of <em>Blindsight</em>'s story is a large part of its beauty. It is a roller-coaster, and not just because it's the result of precision engineering. ( ...) by the end of <em>Blindsight</em> we're left feeling that Siri Keeton might be able to show us the truth of the world, just once, and make us understand, just for a moment&mdash;if only we could trust him as we trust his creator.

Blindsight manages to combine both the scientific literalism of traditional Hard SF and the more figurative modes of expression common to intentionally transgressive works of literary SF.

				Peter Watts continues to do a number of things brilliantly ... [he] succeeds beautifully in conveying his milieu.&nbsp;  This is a very visual book  ... some genius of the screen would have a heyday with such scenes as Lenie battling hypertrophied sea monsters or cracking open her chest to reprogram her somatic parameters. The claustrophobia, the constricted life-support modules and the eerie, deadly, mysterious beauty of the seabed are conveyed in finely tuned, poetic prose.&nbsp;   [Lenie Clarke's] painful mental adjustments are palpable.&nbsp; Subsidiary characters  ... come across vividly.&nbsp;  And Watts remains a master of tight, intricate action scenes, staging battles and rescues and explorations like a choreographer.

				<td><p>There's no sense of new frontiers being opened up, just one of old threads exfoliating. Although Atlantis is beautifully evoked, it's still basically a single stage set ...[and] the Machiavellian doings by both the rifters and the corpses are just too ultra-convoluted and drawn out.

				Watts's writing is just as intricate and involving as ever ...Taken together, the three books represent a sustained assault on the status quo, within science fiction and without, that's hard to read without being affected.  It's all very uncomfortable, but it puts the Rifters Trilogy squarely in a noble tradition within science fiction. Authors such as Orwell, Brunner, and Watts have all told us: <em>Avoid this future at all costs, you bloody fools!</em> It's a message worth repeating until it's heeded.

				Peter Watts is one of the foremost contemporary science fiction writers, a skilled craftsman with a visionary imagination firmly rooted in hard science.  ... <em>Behemoth</em> is far superior to the bulk of contemporary science fiction writing, deftly balancing elements of thriller and military writing with post-apocalyptic visions and a fully realized world terrifyingly near our own. The trilogy is a must-read for even a passing science fiction fan.

				That [&beta;ehemoth: Seppuku] mostly overcomes the handicap of its sundering is a testament to the storytelling ability and imagination of Peter Watts.  [He] blows things up with panache  ...

				[the line].  <span style="color:orange;">Some of these flaws would have been less visible had the book been published as the author

				Watts's primary talent is his skill at projecting paranoia and unease. His characters infect the reader with psyches as twisted as much as their bodies have been modified. There's nothing pleasant or rollicking about this book, but&mdash;as with Watts' earlier works&mdash;that cold darkness somehow manages to evolve into something fascinating.

				The future that Watts has crafted is deep and well-fleshed ... The digital monsters that prowl what was once the Internet are a delightful touch, adding a face of sub-sentient malice to the enemies that besiege the surviving North American enclaves ... There's also a great appendix in which the author discusses which of his Sfnal conceits are already real, which are entirely made up and which have become more feasible since he finished the novel. It's fascinating stuff and made all the more readable because Watts has a caustic and highly cynical wit.
				'Behemoth: B-Max' and 'Behemoth: Seppuku' are enthralling reads and although the decision to publish the two volumes separately is a regrettable one, they both come highly recommended. This is contemporary SF at its best.
