				<a href="rifters\rifteurs.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>For some reason Fleuve Noir chose to release the second rifters book as <em>Rifteurs</em>, rather than <em>Maelstrom</em> (or even <em>Maelstrom</em>, which is what <em>Maelstrom</em> translates into in French). I like this cover; has a nice cyberpunky feel (although I resist classifying the rifters books as punk of any stripe).</p>">

				<a href="rifters\mahlstrom.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Like the Polish iteration, Heyne's covers follow the rifters at a distance; like that iteration, lots of flamey destruction in evidence. Not so sold on Vohwinkel's take on Lenie's diveskin, though...</p>">
					<img src="rifters\mahlstrom-thumb.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="Franz Vohwinkel (2009)"></a>

				<a href="rifters\bmax.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Perhaps the only good thing to arise from Tor's decision to release <em>&beta;ehemoth</em> in two separate volumes was the fact that I now had four Bruce Jensen covers on my work instead of three. This is the cover of <em>&beta;ehemoth: &beta;-Max</em>, with most of the text cropped out to minimize distraction from the art. Love the luminous jade palette.</p>">
					<img src="rifters\bmax-thumb.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="Bruce Jensen (2003)"></a>

				<a href="rifters\seppuku.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>...and with <em>&beta;ehemoth: Seppuku</em>&mdash; commercially, at least, the nadir of my career to this point&mdash; my novels and Jensen's art stopped dating. But it was an amicable break-up. They're still friends. And one of them, at least, entertains faint hope that they might still catch a movie now and then...</p>">
					<img src="rifters\seppuku-thumb.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="Bruce Jensen (2003)"></a>

				<a href="rifters\behemot.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>And yet&mdash; for all my love of Jensen's work&mdash; I think this Polish cover for <em>&beta;ehemot</em> may be my favorite rifters cover ever. Lenie Clarke looks just the way I imagine her; the palette is gorgeous; and the narrative moment it portrays is, to me, one of the most moving of the entire trilogy.</p>">
					<img src="rifters\behemot-thumb.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="Julian Wicik (2014)"></a>


				<a href="rifters\FrenchBehemoth.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Fleuve Noir gave <em>&beta;ehemoth two similar-but-separate covers, one for the trade release, one for the mass-market paperback.  This is the former...</p>">

				<a href="rifters\FrenchBehemothPocket.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>...and this is the latter.</p><p>(Somehow, amazingly, this French publisher managed to release the novel as a <em>single volume</em> without going bankrupt...)">

				<a href="rifters\wellen.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Another publisher that managed to release <em>&beta;ehemoth</em> as a single volume. Not that it made much difference, admittedly; judging by the Amazon reviews <em>Wellen</em> tanked in Germany too. (In fact, none of my books seem to go over especially well in Deutschland. I wonder why Heyne keeps buying them.)</p>">

				<a href="rifters\Starfish_Mikhail-Yemelyanov.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>The cover for the latest Russian edition of <i>Starfish</i>&mdash; and in my opinion, by far the coolest. By Mikhail Yemelyanov.</p>">
					<img src="rifters\Starfish_Mikhail-Yemelyanov-thumb.jpg" width="70" height="70" alt="Yemelyanov (2018)"></a>
					
				<a href="rifters\Maelstrom_Mikhail-Yemelyanov.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Putting aside the vague Venom vibe in this rendering, I quite like Yemelyanov's take on <i>Maelstrom</i> here. The tsunami in the background is nicely symbolic, and the myriad drowned faces are a nice touch (even if I thought they were a bunch of rocks at first glance).</p>">

				<a href="rifters\Behemoth_Mikhail-Yemelyanov.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>It's about time Lubin got his own cover. I gotta say, Yemelyanov's take on <i>βehemoth</i> give Wicik's cover a real run for the money. Totally different aesthetics, but I love them both.</p>">

				<a href="rifters\citizenscard.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Start with a joke, as they say: this was sent to me from someone at my financial institution, after she figured out who I was. In fact, she even put my name forward for an interview with Citizens Bank's monthly newsletter&mdash; kind of a <em>interesting client of the month</em> thing&mdash; and they interviewed me for a solid hour about my life and times. But they never ran the piece, I think because they were looking for something perkier and more uplifting. As the interviewer put it halfway through our conversation: &quot;How can you bring yourself to get up in the morning?&quot;.</p><p>The ironic thing is, about two years later Citizen's Bank went belly up. And I'm still getting up in the morning.</p>">

				<a href="rifters\home.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>This was actually done by me, to accompany a short story (<a href=&quot;http://rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_Home.pdf&quot;>&quot;Home&quot;</a>) set in the rifters universe. I used some Ordovician precursor of Photoshop that could only handle about five layers. It looks crappy by today's standards, but at the time it was quite the accomplishment.</p>">

				<a href="rifters\chris-lees-anorexic.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="<p>Artist Chris Lees describes this as an anorexic Lenie, but in fact there was a little-known female rifter who <em>did</em> waste away like this: Judy Caraco, who apparently broke free and <a href=&quot;http://rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_Home.pdf&quot;>went native</a> after being captured by the Grid Authority near the end of <em>Starfish</em>. I love the sense of slow, eutrophic <em>decay</em> this piece conveys. This could be a forgotten tadpole, listlessly starving to death in a jar in some eight-year-old's bedroom.</p>">

				<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.adamrotter.pl">Adam Rotter</a> took these; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/karolina.nem.cisowska">Karolina Nem Cisowska</a> posed for them. Unusually, they were inspired not by <i>Starfish</i> but by <i>Maelstrom</i>; the result is a spread of desolation and death somewhat at odds with Adam's usual work as&mdash; wait for it&mdash; a <i>wedding photographer</i>.<br><br>
				
				He's posted these pictures over on facebook, under the title <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.507162322756184.1073741877.308105142661904&type=1&pnref=story">Projekt "Syrena"</a>; most are accompanied by the bits of <i>Maelstrom</i> that inspired them. I've stolen both pictures and passages for re-use here, with Adam's permission and with my profound gratitude. It takes a certain gift to see the beauty in carnage.</div><br><br>

The mermaid had been attacked, and had left her assailants in pieces on the shore. ... The mermaid lurked in the foul waters offshore. The sharks did her bidding; at night she would come onto land and steal children to feed to her minions.</p>">

Lenie Clarke had followers; mostly in N'AmPac so far, but the word was spreading. Hordes of disaffected, powerless people had found someone to relate to, a fellow victim with impervious eyes who had learned to fight back. Against what, exactly, there was no consensus. With whose army, not a whisper. Lenie Clarke was a mermaid. Lenie Clarke was a myth.</p>">

Oh, there was still variation; was she infested with incendiary nanotech, did she carry a bioengineered plague, had she brought back some apocalyptic microbe from the deep sea? Differences in detail, nothing more. The essential truth beneath it all had converged: the textbook conic had somehow flipped one-hundred-eighty impossible degrees, and Lenie Clarke had gone from a thousand faces to one. Now, she was only the end of the world.</p>">
