	 Why Believers Kick Atheist Ass at Scrabble
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Here's a fascinating possibility:  that people with religious beliefs are better at pattern-matching than those without.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003679#pone.0003679-Erdelyi1">empirical findings</a> are out of the Netherlands (popsci summary <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16046-religion-alters-visual-perception.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news">here</a>), and are phrased much more conservatively:  when presented with visual stimuli containing two levels of resolution (for example, a big square consisting of a bunch of little rectangles) "Calvinists showed a smaller, but still significant, … global precedence effect than Atheists".  (Basically, they were quicker to recognize the local pattern within the global one.)  Like all good scientists, the authors brim with caveats and qualifiers:  does religion shape perception, or merely attract those with certain perceptual inclinations?  Is this a hallmark of religious belief generally, or merely a feature of the Calvinist eyes-on-the-ground credo of "mind your own business"?  The authors defend their choice of religious group on the reasonable grounds that in a country as small as the Netherlands, there just aren't any other religious groups for whom extraneous variables are comparable; the Catholics mingle too much with the Belgians and the Germans to assume a common cultural context, and Jim Jones' followers never had a significant Dutch component even <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> they were all dead.  Follow-up international studies, encompassing other religious groups, are currently in the planning stages.  In the meantime, Colzato <span style="font-style: italic;">et al</span> admit to being worried about the implications of this whole religion-affects-perception thing:<br><blockquote>…it seems possible that religious beliefs may indeed lead to different and sometimes discrepant and incompatible interpretations of the same incident. That this can happen is a well-known empirical fact but that it can originate in basic automatic visual operations that precede conscious representation is surprising and in some sense worrying — as it seems to work against the scientific ideal that careful observation is sufficient to reach agreements about basic facts and what we consider reality.</blockquote>But here's the thing.  The study focused on whether or not Calvinists had a different "global precedence" effect than atheists, and they pretty much confined their analysis to that question.  But I'm not writing for a peer-reviewed journal here<sup>1</sup>, so I can wander a bit further afield: and if you actually look at the data they present, Calvinists are faster on the draw than atheists on both local <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> global levels; and their error rate is lower, too:<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/journal.pone.0003679.t001-726794.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 303px; height: 320px;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/journal.pone.0003679.t001-726557.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br>So I say, screw this global/local bullshit.  The take-home message <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm</span> reading here is that Calvinists are just better at pattern-matching than atheists, period.  And I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that when Colzato <span style="font-style: italic;">et al</span> get around to testing other religious groups, they'll find the same pattern:  I think they'll find that ass-hamster fans of <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> stripe will be better pattern-matchers than us heathens.<br><br>You shouldn't be surprised by this; we've talked about it before.  A few weeks back — during my <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2008/10/understanding-sarah-palin-or-god-is-in.html">recent infamous dissection</a> of fear, religion, and the Republican Right —I cited a couple of sources describing the increased tendency among believers to see patterns and connections in random visual static, to attribute Agency and Cause where none exists.  And over a year ago <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2007/10/view-from-left.html">I mused</a> about lateral specialization in our cerebral hemispheres, how one half of the brain seems to look for patterns while the other is more pragmatic.  I even raised the possibility that one might deliberately crank up the pattern-matching modules (while giving the pragmatic ones veto power) so that one day we might actually derive legitimate scientific insights from religious rapture.<br><br>So these Netherlandian findings give me hope.  At the very least, they give me a legitimate peer-reviewed title to stick in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumbspeech</span>'s appendix — because it is this exact process which inspires the religious group that figures front-and-center in that book (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bicameral Order</span> by name, " a bastard Jainist sect with one foot in ancient India and the other in the splice-and-dice frankenworks of late-21rst-century neuroscience").<br><br>So today is a day to celebrate my shrewd insight, eyesight, and foresight into the future of the Human experience.  And also to mention, apropos of nothing in particular, that the Dresden Dolls in general and Amanda Palmer in particular absofuckinglutely rock my world.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:85%;"><sup>1</sup> Well, not that you lot don't review it to within an inch of its life, of course.  Just that your reviews can't stop me from posting</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/Dumbspeech.html">Dumbspeech</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/sociobiology.html">sociobiology</a></p>

	 Understanding Sarah Palin:  Or, God Is In The Wattles

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/ichatimage891131384xf6-719899.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/ichatimage891131384xf6-719865.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Here's a question for you.  Why hasn't natural selection driven the religious right to extinction?<br><br>You should forgive me for asking.  After all, here is a group of people who base their lives on patently absurd superstitions that fly in the face of empirical evidence.  It's as if I suddenly chose to believe that I could walk off the edges of cliffs with impunity; you would not expect me to live very long.  You would expect me to leave few if any offspring.  You would expect me to get <i>weeded out</i>.<br><br>And yet, this obnoxious coterie of retards — people openly and explicitly contemptuous of "intellectuals" and "evilutionists" and, you know, anyone who actually spends their time <i>learning</i> stuff —  they not only refuse to die, they appear to rule the world.  Some Alaskan airhead who can't even fake the name of a newspaper, who can't seem to say anything without getting it wrong, who bald-facedly states in a formal debate setting that she's not even going to <i>try</i> to answer questions she finds unpalatable (or she would state as much, if she could say "unpalatable" without tripping over her own tongue) — this person, this <i>behavior</i>, is regarded as successful even by her detractors.  The primary reason for her popularity amongst the all-powerful "low-information voters"<sup>1</sup>?  In-your-face religious fundamentalism and an eye tic that would make a Tourette's victim blush.<br><br>You might suggest that my analogy is a bit loopy:  young-earth creationism may fly in the face of reason, but it hardly has as much immediate survival relevance as my own delusory immunity to gravity.  I would disagree.  The Christian Church has been an anvil around the neck of scientific progress for centuries.  It took the Catholics four hundred years to apologize to Galileo; a hundred fifty for an Anglican middle-management type to admit that they might <a href="http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=better-late-than-never-clergyman-sa-2008-09-16">owe one to Darwin</a> too (although his betters immediately <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSLG62672220080916">slapped him down</a> for it).  Even today, we fight an endless series of skirmishes with fundamentalists who keep trying to sneak creationism in through the back door of science classes across the continent.  (I'm given to understand that Islamic fundies are doing pretty much the same thing in Europe.)  More people in the US believe in angels than in natural selection.  And has anyone <i>not </i>noticed that religious fundamentalists also tend to be climate-change deniers?<br><br>Surely, any cancer that attacks the very intellect of a society would put the society itself at a competitive disadvantage.  Surely, tribes founded on secular empiricism would develop better technology, better medicines, better hands-on understanding of The Way Things Work, than tribes gripped by primeval cloud-worshipping superstition<sup>2</sup>.  Why, then, are there so few social systems based on empiricism, and why are god-grovellers so powerful across the globe?  Why do the Olympians keep getting their asses handed to them by a bunch of intellectual paraplegics?<br><br>The great thing about science is, it can even answer ugly questions like this.  And a lot of pieces have been falling into place lately.  Many of them have to do with the brain's fundamental role as a pattern-matcher.<br><br>Let's start with this study <a href="..\articles\Science_LackingControlIncreasesIllusoryPatternPerception.html">here</a>, in the latest issue of <i>Science</i>.  It turns out that the less control people feel they have over their lives, the more likely they are to perceive images in random visual static; the more likely they are to see connections and conspiracies in unrelated events.  The more powerless you feel, the more likely you'll see faces in the clouds.  (Belief in astrology also goes up during times of social stress.)<br><br>Some of you may remember that I speculated along such lines back during <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2007/12/god-shaped-hole.html">my rant</a> against that evangelical abortion that Francis Collins wrote while pretending to be a scientist; but thanks to Jennifer Whitson and her buddies, speculation resolves into fact.  Obama was dead on the mark when he said that people cling to religion and guns during hard times.  The one arises from loss of control, and the other from an attempt to get some back.<br><br>Leaving Lepidoptera (<i>please </i>don't touch the displays, little boy, heh heh heh—  Oh, cute...) — moving to the next aisle, we have Arachnida, the spiders.  And according to <a href="..\articles\Science_Oxley_et_al_2008.html">findings reported by Douglas Oxley and his colleagues</a> (supplemental material <a href="..\articles\Science_Oxley_et_al_2008_supplement.html">here</a>), right-wingers are significantly more scared of these furry little arthropods than left-wingers tend to be: at least, conservatives show stronger stress responses than liberals to "threatening" pictures of large spiders perched on human faces.<br><br>It's not a one-off effect, either.  Measured in terms of blink amplitude and skin conductance, the strongest stress responses to a variety of threat stimuli occurred among folks who "favor defense spending, capital punishment, patriotism, and the Iraq War".  In contrast, those who "support foreign aid, liberal immigration policies, pacifism, and gun control" tended to be pretty laid-back when confronted with the same stimuli.  Oxley <i>et al</i> close off the piece by speculating that differences in political leanings may result from differences in the way the amygdala is wired— and that said wiring, in turn, has a genetic component.  The implication is that right-wing/left-wing beliefs may to some extent be hardwired,  making them relatively immune to the rules of evidence and reasoned debate. (Again, this <i>is</i> pure speculation. The experiments didn't extend into genetics.  But it would explain a lot.)<br><br>One cool thing about the aforementioned studies is that they have relatively low sample sizes, both in two-digit range.  Any pattern that shows statistical significance in a small sample has got to be pretty damn strong; both of these are.<br><br>Now let's go back a ways, to a Cornell Study from 1999 called "<a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf">Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments</a>".  It's a depressing study, with depressing findings:<br><ul><li>People tend to overestimate their own smarts.</li><li>Stupid people tend to overestimate their smarts more than the truly smart do.</li><li>Smart people tend to assume that everyone else is as smart as they are; they honestly can't understand why dumber people just don't "get it", because it doesn't occur to them that those people actually <i>are</i> dumb.</li><li>Stupid people, in contrast, tend to not only regard themselves as smarter than everyone else, they tend to regard truly smart people as especially stupid. This holds true <i>even when these people are shown empirical proof that they are less competent than those they deride. </i></li></ul>So.  The story so far:<br><ol><li>People perceive nonexistent patterns, meanings, and connections in random data when they are stressed, scared, and generally feel a loss of control in their own lives.</li><li>Right-wing people are more easily scared/stressed than left-wing people.  They are also more likely to cleave to authority figures and protectionist policies.  There <i>may</i> be a genetic component to this.</li><li> The dumber you are, the less likely you'll be able to recognize your own stupidity, and the lower will be your opinion of people who are smarter than you (even while those people keep treating you as though you are just as smart as they are)</li></ol>Therefore (I would argue) the so-called "right wing" is especially predisposed to believe in moralizing, authoritarian Invisible Friends. And the dumber individuals (of any stripe) are, the more immune they are to reason.  <b>Note that, to paraphrase John Stuart Mill, I am <i>not saying that conservatives are stupid</i></b>  (I myself know some very smart conservatives), <span style="font-weight: bold;">but that stupid people tend to be conservative.</span>  Whole other thing.<br><br>So what we have, so far, is a biological mechanism for the prevalence of religious superstition in right-wing populations.  What we need now is a reason why such populations tend to be so damn <i>successful</i>, given the obvious shortcomings of superstition as opposed to empiricism.<br><br>Which brings us to Norenzayan and Shariff's review paper in last week's <i>Science</i> on "<a href="..\articles\Science_TheOriginandEvolutionofReligiousProsociality.html">The Origin and Evolution of Religious Prosociality</a>".  To get us in the mood they remind us of several previous studies, a couple of which I may have mentioned here before (at least, I mentioned them <i>somewhere</i> — if they're on the 'crawl, I evidently failed to attach the appropriate "ass-hamsters" tag).   For example, it turns out that people are less likely to cheat on an assigned task if the lab tech lets slip that the ghost of a girl who was murdered <i>in this very building</i> was sighted down the hall the other day.<br><br>That's right.  Plant the thought that some ghost might be watching you, and you become more trustworthy.  Even sticking a picture of a pair of eyes on the wall reduces the incidence of cheating, even though no one would consciously mistake a drawing of eyes for the real thing.  Merely planting the <i>idea</i> of surveillance seems to be enough to improve one's behavior.  (I would also remind you of an earlier <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2007/08/selfish-bastards-every-one.html">crawl entry</a> reporting that so-called "altruistic" acts in our society tend to occur mainly when someone else is watching, although N&amp;S don't cite that study in their review.)<br><br>There's also the recent nugget from which this figure was cadged:<br><div style="text-align: left;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/secular_v_religious-781652.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/secular_v_religious-781630.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>This study found not only that religious communes last longer than secular ones, but that even among religious communes the ones that last longest are those with the most onerous, repressive, authoritarian rules.<br></div><br>And so on.  Norenzayan and Shariff trot out study after study, addressing a variety of questions that may seem unrelated at first.  If, as theorists suggest, human social groupings can only reach 150 members or so before they collapse or fragment from internal stress, why does the real world serve up so many groupings of greater size?  (Turns out that the larger the size of a group, the more likely that its members believe in a moralizing, peeping-tom god.)  Are religious people more likely than nonreligious ones to help out someone in distress?  (Not so much.)   What's the most common denominator tying together acts of charity by the religious?  (Social optics.  "Self-reported belief in God or self-reported religious devotion," the paper remarks wryly, "was not a reliable indicator of generous behavior in anonymous settings.")  And why is it that religion seems especially prevalent in areas with chronic water and resource shortages?<br><br>It seems to come down to two things:  surveillance and freeloading.  The surveillance element is pretty self-evident.  People engage in goodly behavior primarily to increase their own social status, to make themselves appear more valuable to observers.  But by that same token, there's no point in being an upstanding citizen if there <i>are</i> no observers.  In anonymous settings, you can cheat.<br><br>You can also cheat in <i>non</i>anonymous settings, if your social group is large enough to get lost in.  In small groups, everybody knows your name; if you put out your hand at dinner but couldn't be bothered hunting and gathering, if you sleep soundly at night and never stand guard at the perimeter, it soon becomes clear to everyone that you're a parasite.  You'll get the shit kicked out of you, and be banished from the tribe.  But as social groupings become larger you lose that everyone-knows-everyone safeguard.  You can move from burb to burb, sponging and moving on before anyone gets wise—<br><br>—<i>unless</i>  the costs of joining that community in the first place are so bloody high that it just isn't worth the effort.  This is where the onerous, old-testament social rituals come into play.<br><br>Norenzayan and Shariff propose that<br><blockquote>"the cultural spread of religious prosociality may have promoted stable levels of cooperation in large groups, where reputational and reciprocity incentives are insufficient.  If so, then reminders of God may not only reduce cheating, but may also increase generosity toward strangers as much as reminders of secular institutions promoting prosocial behavior."</blockquote>And they cite their own data to support it.  But they also admit that "professions of religious belief can be easily faked", so that<br><blockquote>"evolutionary pressures must have favored costly religious commitment, such as ritual participation and various restrictions on behavior, diet, and life-style, that validates the sincerity of otherwise unobservable religious belief."</blockquote>In other word, anyone can talk the talk.  But if you're willing to give all your money to the church and your twelve-year-old daughter to the patriarch, dude, you're obviously one of us.<br><br>Truth in Advertising is actually a pretty common phenomenon in nature.  Chicken wattles are a case in point; what the hell <i>good</i> are those things, anyway?  What do they do?  Turns out that they display information about a bird's health, in a relatively unfakeable way. The world is full of creatures who lie about their attributes. Bluegills spread their gill covers when facing off against a competitor; cats go all puffy and arch-backed when getting ready to tussle. Both behaviors serve to make the performer seem larger than he really is— they lie, in other words.   Chicken wattles aren't like that; they more honestly reflect the internal state of the animal.  It takes metabolic energy to keep them plump and colorful. A rooster loaded down with parasites is a sad thing to see, his wattles all pale and dilapidated; a female can see instantly what kind of shape he's in by looking at those telltales.  You might look to the peacock's tail for another example<sup>3</sup>, or the red ass of a healthy baboon.  (We humans have our own telltales— lips, breasts, ripped pecs and triceps— but you haven't been able to count on those ever since implants, steroids, and Revlon came down the pike.)  "Religious signaling" appears to be another case in point.  As Norenzayan and Shariff point out, "religious groups imposing more costly requirements have members who are more committed."  Hence,<br><blockquote>"Religious communes were found to outlast those motivated by secular ideologies, such as  socialism. … religious communes imposed more than twice as many costly requirements (including food taboos and fasts, constraints on material possessions, marriage, sex, and communication with the outside world) than secular ones… Importantly for costly religious signaling, the number of costly requirements predicted religious commune longevity after the study controlled for population size and income and the year the commune was founded… Finally, religious ideology was no longer a predictor of commune longevity, once the number of costly requirements was statistically controlled, which suggests that the survival advantage of religious communes was due to the greater costly commitment of their members, rather than other aspects of religious ideology."</blockquote>Reread that last line.  It's not the ideology <i>per sé</i> that confers the advantage; it's the cost of the signal that matters.  Once again, we strip away the curtain and God stands revealed as ecological energetics, writ in a fancy font.<br><br>These findings aren't carved in stone.  A lot of the studies are correlational, the models are in their infancy, yadda yadda yadda.  But the data are coming in thick and fast, and they point to a pretty plausible model:<br><ul><li>Fear and stress result in loss of perceived control;</li><li>Loss of perceived control results in increased perception of nonexistent patterns (N&amp;S again:  "The tendency to detect agency in nature likely supplied the cognitive template that supports the pervasive belief in supernatural agents");</li><li>Those with right-wing political beliefs tend to scare more easily;</li><li>Authoritarian religious systems based on a snooping, surveillant God, with high membership costs and antipathy towards outsiders, are more cohesive, less invasible by cheaters, and longer-lived.  They also tend to flourish in high-stress environments.</li></ul>And there you have it.  The Popular Power of Palin,  explained.  So the next question is<br><br>Now that we can explain the insanity, what are we going to <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> about it?<br><br><b>Coda 10/10/08:</b>  And as the tide turns, and the newsfeeds and Youtube videos pile up on my screen, the feature that distinguishes right from left seems ever-clearer:  fear.  See the angry mobs at Republican rallies.  Listen to the shouts of <i>terrorist </i>and <i>socialist</i> and <i>kill him! </i>whenever Obama's name is mentioned.  And just tonight, when even John McCain seemed to realise that things had gone too far, and tried to describe the hated enemy as "a decent man"— <i>he was roundly booed by his own supporters.</i><br><br>How many times have the Dems had their asses handed to them by well-oiled Republican machinery?  How many times have the Dems been shot down by the victorious forces of Nixons and Bushes?  Were the Democrats ever this bloodthirsty in the face of defeat?<br><br>Oxley <i>et al</i> are really on to something. These people are fucking <i>terrified.</i><br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:85%;">Photo credit for Zombie Jesus:  no clue. Someone just sent it to me.<br><br><sup>1</sup>And isn't <i>that</i> a nice CNNism for "moron"?  It might seem like a pretty thing veil to <i>you</i> lot, but then again, CNN isn't worried about alienating viewers with higher-than-room-temperature IQs.<br><sup>2</sup>And to all you selfish-gene types out there, where you been?  Group-selection is back in vogue this decade.  Believe me, I was as surprised as you…<br><sup>3</sup>Although we might be getting into "Handicap Principle" territory here, which is a related but different wattle of fish.  I confess I'm not up on the latest trends in this area…<br></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/evolution.html">evolution</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/sociobiology.html">sociobiology</a></p>

	 I Am  Fundamentalist, And So Can You.
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This started out as a post about a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=402381&c=2">recently-reported</a> negative correlation between IQ and religious belief (thanks to Craig McGill for the link).  It was going to be relatively restrained by local standards; while it's hard to resist the temptation to rub one's hands at yet more evidence that only Stupid People Have Imaginary Friends, I'd have voiced reservations over the unwarranted conflation of "academics" with "smart people" (believe me, there are as many dumb folks in those hallowed halls as there are anywhere else except maybe Fox News); the use of a single score to measure that multifaceted bag of traits we call "intelligence"; even the sloppiness of some of the third-party coverage (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/12/god_boffins/">this headline</a>, for example, gets the study's findings completely ass-backwards).<br><br>In the end, though, I decided to leave those poor bastards alone and come out of the closet myself.<br><br>I use the word "fundamentalist" in the sense promoted by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindly-Inquisitors-Attacks-Free-Thought/dp/0226705765/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213720963&sr=1-1">Jonathan Rauch</a>:  anyone who cannot seriously entertain the possibility that they are wrong about their basic beliefs.   It applies pretty obviously to Biblical literalists and their ilk, but the term is not limited to them.  It extends to me.  I suspect it even extends to the likes of Richard Dawkins, even though he has stated publicly that he would be willing to change his mind on the subject of God.  All it would take, he says, is "evidence".<br><br>Which is a laudable attitude, and one that reflects the basic difference between science and religion.  The question that's been occurring to me lately, though, is, what <span style="font-style: italic;">kind</span> of evidence would it take to turn me into a believer?  How much would be enough?  God is such an outrageous proposition from so many angles that almost any alternative explanation would be more parsimonious.  Mass hallucination.  Brain tumors.  The Matrix.  Aliens with a propensity for juvenile practical jokes.<br><br>Imagine a scenario in which the heavens literally opened up, and a Big White Dude with a Mighty Beard and a flotilla of cherubim stroking His Divine Genitalia stared down at me through the clouds and proclaimed in a mighty voice,<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:180%;">I, God, exist!  Take your photographs!  Run your tricorder!<br>BELIEVE IN ME!</span><br></div><br>Would I believe?  Fuck no.  This has to be some kind of trick. And no matter how much evidence piles up — a smiley face embedded in pi at the thirteen-trillionth decimal place; a cosmological consensus that yes, there's really only one universe, and it really just does happen to be configured with all its physical constants tuned precisely to permit our existence; the literal appearance of the Four Horsemen — <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of that, appearing in the face of such astronomically-massive odds, would still have to be weighed against the likelihood of the alternative.<br><br>What are the odds that I'm a brain in a tank or a computer simulation, and some bored undergrad is fucking with my sensory inputs?  Pretty damn low.  What are the odds that an entire physical multiverse was created by means unknown by an omnipotent omniscient sentient entity that exists eternally, without any cause or creator of its own?<br><br>Lower.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Way</span> lower.  (Or at least, that model raises far more numerous and substantive questions than it pretends to answer.)<br><br>The bottleneck here is my own mental processes, my own ability to parse input from the outside world, to trust that said input even <span style="font-style: italic;">reflects</span> an objective outside world.  The limits are always in me; the brain contains too many tricks and shortcuts to trust implicitly, especially if it serves up something I consider impossible.  Whatever input is thrust into my face, <span style="font-style: italic;">hack</span> will always be a more parsimonious explanation than <span style="font-style: italic;">god</span>.<br><br>Which leaves me unconvertible, and reduces me to the status of fundamentalist— and Dawkins' grand pronouncement about "evidence" to empty sophistry.<br><br>Sucks to introspect.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a></p>

	 Athieist Group Born Again
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Pursuant to <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2008/02/in-defense-of-scientology.html">Monday's post</a>,  that MySpace athiests group is <a href="http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=groups.groupProfile&groupID=100002606&Mytoken=2D2AA199-7777-4D8F-BB118B8C54BAD16A17021819">back up</a> and running.  According to a <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/02/recent_headlines.html#comment-13544">comment</a> on Charlie Stross's blog, MySpace never deleted it in the first place; rather, it was hacked out of existence by some third party.  Anybody have any further info on this?  According to the <a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/1933">story</a> I linked to before, the group had been hacked in the past but this was a whole different thing.  Perhaps said commenter was confusing the two events — or perhaps, as he claims, the original report was "grossly inaccurate".<br><br>"Thanks to Myspace for restoring our group." appears on the group's splash page, which doesn't tell me much.  I've applied for membership to look further inside, but it's one of those moderated thingies so I have to wait until they get back to me.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a></p>

	 In Defense of Scientology
	 
    </h3>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/Max_Headroom-792113.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/Max_Headroom-792111.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Yeah, I kind of thought that might get your attention.<br><br>Don't worry, it's not what you're thinking.  Nothing exists in isolation; every object stands in contrast to its background, every thing is relative to everything else.  So when I take a stand in defense of an admittedly pernicious, powerful, and downright idiotic cult, you knows that it is not that I love L. Ron more, but that I love Rome less.<br><br>Specifically, Constantine-era Rome, just around the time of  the Nicene Creeds.<br><br>These <i><a href="http://www.partyvan.info/index.php/Project_Chanology">Anonymous</a></i> folks have been getting a lot of attention lately.  They <i>hates</i> the Scientologists, my precious, they hates them <i>forever</i>.  They release <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=JCbKv9yiLiQ">Hawking-voiced manifestos</a> accompanied by <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=yozvaMGkDjo">Master-Chief knock-offs</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QubW_LhiqDY">time-lapse cloudscapes</a>.  They tell us all about how bad Scientology is.  They launch <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,141839-c,hackers/article.html">DDoS attacks</a>, and <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PkMIhR79ujw">organize protests</a>; they live in the wires.  They are Max Headroom made flesh.<br><br>But what exactly is so bad about Scientology?  What do they do to get people so riled up?<br><br>Well, let's see.  They expect their followers to believe really stupid things about the universe, things that fly in the face of pretty much every scientific discovery ever made.  They extort money from their <s>parishioners</s> victims.  They litigate, harass and intimidate those who challenge them from without; they stifle, brainwash, and (some say) even kill those who question them from within.  They do not tolerate dissent.  They decide how and when women will be allowed to reproduce, strip away a woman's control of her own body.  And they are <i>growing</i>; before long, many fear, they will have their hands in the back pockets of governments the world over.  Who knows how many politicians and power brokers already suck at L. Ron's teat, while some radio-controlled jester gibbers and capers and leaps around on Oprah's couch to keep our attention off the guys loading up the truck in the back alley?<br><br>Is it just me, or are these guys complete fucking <i>amateurs</i>?<br><br>You think the Hubbardheads have political power?  There's a word for the electoral chances of any political candidate who admits to being a Scientologist:  "negligible".  By an odd coincidence, the same word describes the prospects of any political candidate who <i>doesn't</i> admit — nay, <i>proclaim</i> — that they're a Christian.<br><br>Litigation?  The crushing of dissent?  Only pussies run to the courts.  The largest atheist group on the planet — 35,000 members — <a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/node/1933">just got deleted from MySpace</a>.  They violated no terms of service.  They committed no offense.  But they were found offensive, nonetheless;  some Christians complained.  Now they are gone.<br><br>Not even academia, the self-proclaimed haven of free and enlightened discourse, escapes the shadow.  Wilfrid Laurier University, here in Ontario, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/02/admitting_that_you_have_no_rel.php">just denied official recognition</a> to the Laurier Freethought Alliance because the promotion of "a fulfilling life without religion and superstition" would be potentially offensive to the believers on campus.  (Note that in this case, nobody even complained.  Nobody had a <i>chance</i> to complain, because the whole damn group was aborted before it even came to term.)<br><br>I'm not reading about this in the media.  Feeding '<span style="font-style: italic;">"Atheist and Agnostic Group" AND myspace</span>' into Google News nets me two measly hits.  "<span style="font-style: italic;">Laurier Freethought Alliance</span>"<em></em> gets me none at all.  The only people who seem to even be aware of this, much less give a damn, are the biologists and atheists themselves.  You gotta read the science blogs to even hear about it.<br><br>No lawsuits.  No messy publicity.  Just a few complaints, and *poof*.  As if we never existed.  Now <span style="font-style: italic;">that's</span> power.<br><br>Oppression of dissidents?  Demonization of outsiders?  Institutionalized violence?  Penetration into the highest levels of societal control?  Rs and Ks, there is just no comparison.<br><br>Don't get me wrong.  I've got no more time for the Scientologists than I have for any other religion<sup>1</sup>.  (Actually, now that I think of it, sometimes I have quite a lot of time for the Jehovah's Witnesses.  I even invite them in and ask them questions.  More often than not, they're the ones who ask to leave.)  Superstition is a really lousy basis for figuring out how the universe works.  But going after the Scientologists in a world full of Christians, Muslims, and Trekkies is like surveying a world ravaged by AIDS and devoting yourself to the eradication of the hangnail.<br><br>I don't know who these Anonymous people are.  But I think they should stop picking on someone their own size.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">1</sup><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">There was a time when I would have simply dismissed the whole thing by pointing out that anyone stupid enough to buy into that crap probably deserves to be exploited.  I still believe that, but the problem is the world is evidently cheek-to-jowl with people who </span><i style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">are</i><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);"> that stupid, and the smarter folks who raise and butcher them use their herds to do an awful lot of damage to the rest of us.</span></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/rant.html">rant</a></p>

	 The Church of the Buttered Nose
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>So you start the day as you always have: you wake up to the feel of a claw piercing your internasal septum. You get out of bed, stumble down the hall, feed the cats. Pee. Open the blinds. Wander back into the kitchen; nuke a couple of muffins; mix up a bowl of oatmeal; smear butter on your nose so Chip the Cat (waiting expectantly on top of the fridge) can lick it off with his rough, radula-like tongue. Extract muffins from microwave. Load up your RSS feeds. Put the coffee on, pour a glass of OJ...<br><br>And then one day you do a double-take, and say to yourself  <span style="font-style: italic;">Wait a minute — how long have I been smearing butter on my nose so that Chip could lick it off? How did that</span> start<span style="font-style: italic;">? And why has it never occurred to me until now?</span><br><br>And then, if you're especially perceptive, you may wonder <span style="font-style: italic;">How would this look to someone who hadn't been raised in the Church of the Buttered Nose?</span><br><br>Of course, most people aren't that perceptive. At least, not consciously; there must be some kind of subliminal subroutine asking that question, though, or they wouldn't be so quick to silence anyone who voices it aloud<sup>1</sup>. We've always buttered our noses, you see. As long as we can remember. The origins of our ways are lost in the mists of time, but surely the very antiquity of those origins confers credibility, yes? It <span style="font-style: italic;">feels right</span> to us.<br><br>Still.   Were some naïve overnight guest to catch me <span style="font-style: italic;">in flagrante dairio</span>, their reaction might well be "What the fuck!?", even though my reaction to their reaction would merely be "What?" And I guess Communion, Baptism, and Human Sacrifice are the same sort of thing.  I bet this is how religions (or at least, religious rituals) get started.  We have always buttered our noses. What's the big deal?<br><br>Of course, there are similarities and there are differences. Both cats and gods seem to expect absolute subservience and constant praise. Both seem capricious, quick to anger, and prone to the holding of grudges. Both demand sacrifice.<br><br>Cats aren't omnipotent, though. That's one big difference.<br><br>Oh, and they exist. That's another.<br><br><br><sup>1</sup> <span style="font-size:78%;">I recently got a very huffy e-mail from someone who took exception to being described as "religious" rather than "spiritual", evoking fond memories of The Judean People's Front taking umbrage at being mistaken for The People's Front of Judea.  Seems to me, though, that once you've drunk from the Supernatural Kool-Aid, any subordinate distinctions come down to chrome and upholstery.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ass-hamsters.html">ass-hamsters</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/misc.html">misc</a></p>

If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."</blockquote><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">After which Collins cuts in and asks "Why do we have a 'God-shaped vacuum' in our hearts unless it is meant to be filled?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Where to start. (Beyond noting that while some sort of vacuum does seem to persist in one Francis Collins, it is unlikely to reside in his thorax...) <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Let's start with a general observation. Collins' understanding of natural selection appears to be a woefully-ignorant caricature in which every organism always behaves optimally to promote its own fitness, and every instance in which this doesn't happen constitutes a failure of evolutionary theory calling out for Divine intervention. What he doesn't seem to understand (or perhaps, what he's hoping you won't) is that the whole basis of natural selection is <i><i>variation</i></i>. Organisms differ; some do better than others; the losers leave fewer offspring. Nature, in other words, is chock-full of creatures who do not selfishly spread their genes, who benefit others at their own expense. Conspecifics might call such organisms "unsuccessful competitors". Parasites would call them "hosts". Predators would call them "food". The Archdiocese calls them "parishioners".<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Perhaps you're thinking that's a cheap shot; prey may not <span style="font-style: italic;">successfuly</span> spread their genes, but that's not for want of trying.  I would counter that the same could be said of all those good folks who turn the other cheek expecting a grand payoff in the Kingdom of Heaven.  Either way, this Collins guy needs to be taught the basics — not just of biology, but of elementary logic. To claim that non-selfish acts contradict evolutionary theory is like claiming that blow jobs contradict the orgasm's role in reproduction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">But fine: he's talking about the <i><i>knowing</i></i> and <i><i>voluntary</i></i> sacrifice of one's own interests to benefit another. <i><i>That's</i></i> what he defines as uniquely human. Except it isn't. Empathy for nonrelatives, efforts expended to help others (even members of different species), have been documented in nonhuman primates and cetaceans. The concepts of fair play and justice don't seem to be uniquely human either. Contrary to Collins' claims, sociobiologists don't have any real trouble reconciling such actions with evolutionary processes; in fact, the neurochemistry underlying empathy is a pretty basic social-cohesion mechanism.<span style="">   </span>And while Collins has a field day hauling out Oskar Schindler and Mother Theresa as examples of selfless service to a greater good, he's only cherry-picking one or two convenient outliers from a cloud of data. Readers of this obscure little newscrawl may remember that there <i><i>is</i></i> a data cloud, statistically quantifiable, and <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2007/08/selfish-bastards-every-one.html">it shows</a> that people tend to engage in risky heroics or acts of altruistic generosity primarily when it improves their chances of getting laid. (And don't bother pointing out that Mommy Theresa's chances of that were pretty much nil — we both know the basement circuitry works the same way regardless of motivational overlays.  Besides, she was expecting a whole other kind of payoff, just as Schindler more likely than not feared some kind of pay<span style="font-style: italic;">back</span>.)  You may also remember that this "Moral Law", such as it is, is inconsistent and often downright wrong, that the <i><i>truly</i></i> altruistic — those who'd unhesitatingly sacrifice two of their own children to save four of someone else's, for example — suffer from a specific and precise form of <a href="..\newscrawl_2007-2.htm#04-04-07">brain damage</a>. The truly moral are those with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; not, so far as I've heard, a "universal" aspect of the Human condition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">And that's not even getting into the self-sacrificing behaviour of those who have merely been tricked into furthering someone else's agenda.<span style="">   </span>How many Christians would have marched in the Crusades, how many jihadists would have strapped bombs across their bellies, how many missionaries would have risked disease and death in darkest Africa if they'd actually believed that eternal damnation was waiting at the end of it? (Now <i><i>that</i></i> would be altruism.) Is Collins really so blind to the workings of his own religion that he can't tell the difference between true selflessness and the manipulation of selfish motives by parasites wielding imaginary payoffs?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Which leads to another, and mind-bogglingly obvious failing of Collins' argument: the ubiquity of the "Moral Law". His claim that we all share the same standards of right and wrong would, I expect, come as news to all those cultures throughout history who kept (and keep) slaves, who mutilate the genitals of their women, who regarded (and regard) foreign races, beliefs, and behaviours as things to be avoided at best and hammered into extinction at worst. The ongoing genocides of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries provide eloquent testimony to the ubiquity of Collins' Moral Law, and while he leaves himself a bit of wiggle room (we all have the Moral Law, you see, but some of us choose to <i><i>ignore</i></i> it), he cites nothing to justify the claim that this sense of right and wrong <i><i>is</i></i> universal beyond the one-two punch that a) <i><i>he</i></i> feels it and so do all his friends, and b) C.S. Lewis told him so. <span style=""> </span>(In fact, reading <span style="font-style: italic;">The Language of God</span>, you get the sense that Francis Collins has anointed himself C.S. Lewis's Official Corporeal Sock Puppet.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">For all his talk of agape and altruism, Collins may be the most profoundly self-centred human being I've read. The possibility that everyone doesn't feel just the way he does seems completely beyond his grasp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">The search for God? I'm a pretty introspective dude, and I can say with a high degree of confidence that I don't have anything like that gnawing away inside me. I recognise that many people do— but I also recognise that our brains are hardwired to see patterns even where none exist, to attribute agency even to purely indifferent phenomena.<span style="">  It's a small enough step from the "Theory of Mind" that allows us to suss out the agendas of the creatures and conspecifics we encounter day to day.   So the very </span>clouds can look angry to us, or benign; and who <i><i>hasn't</i></i> wanted to put a brick through that fucking laptop and its fucking Blue Screen of Death which always, malevolently, crashes your system when you're six hours from deadline and have forgotten to save? <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Apply equal parts ignorance, pattern-matching, and the attribution of motives onto nature's canvas: angels and demons sprout like Spears sprogs behind every rock (much as they appeared to Collins in his frozen waterfall). But Collins doesn’t even admit that such neural circuitry <i><i>exists</i></i>, much less contemplate its potential relevance to human superstition. No mention at all of <a href="http://www.shaktitechnology.com/">Persinger's</a> work, or <a href="http://psy.ucsd.edu/chip/ramabio.html">Ramachandran</a>'s. Not a word about the brain's God Module. And once again, no credit whatsoever to the guys with the mitres and crosses — not to mention the iron maidens in their basements —  and the role <i><i style="">they</i></i> might have played in inculcating a sense of the divine into the culture (albeit granted, a form of the Divine that seems chronically in need of alms).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">So Collins' central, most rigorous argument for a personal god — who created heaven and earth and made us and <i><i>only</i></i> us in his image — is that everybody shares the same sense of right and wrong (except they don't); that everybody seeks God (speak for yourself, buddy; I'm happy if I can just find a decent pint of Rickards); that Human beings are unique among all species in being altruistic and moral (except we're not); and that there's no other explanation but the God of Abraham for any of this (except there sure as shit <i><i>is</i></i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Let me repeat: this is his <i><i>strongest</i></i> argument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">It's not his only one, though. Collins commits numerous other sins, easily recognised by anyone with even a passing familiarity with the moves of flat-earthers and climate-change deniers and spin-doctors the world over. Statements initially introduced with all the right caveats ("If we accept the possibility of the supernatural, then it is possible that...") reappear later, unsubstantiated but nonetheless miraculously transmuted into statements of absolute fact (believers are "right to hold fast to the eternal truths of the Bible"). Legitimate objections to his positions (e.g., that religious beliefs are irrelevant to the study of Nature) are dismissed for no better reason than that Collins finds them unpalatable ("that doesn't resonate with most individuals' human experience", he writes). In the manner of fundies everywhere, and in the spirit of that book he holds most holy, he contradicts himself whenever it suits him. At one point he argues against the God-as-wishful-thinking model by pointing out that a product of wish-fulfillment would be cuddly and indulgent, not demanding and judgmental as the God of Abraham is wont to be. (Oddly, the prospect of an intimidating God invoked not for comfort, but as a way for folks in funny hats to exert control over credulous followers, never seems to occur to him.) But when facing off against those who'd claim that God scattered photons and fossils across heaven and earth to test our faith, he decides that a little wishful thinking is just fine: "Would God as the great deceiver be an entity anyone would <i><i>want</i></i> to worship?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">He rejects a naturalistic universe because after all, something had to kick-start the Big Bang (it couldn't have just booted itself, that would be silly) — then changes the rules to exempt his own model from the same criticism (oh, nothing had to create God, God just booted Himself). (As I would too, hard in my own ass, if I'd created a sentient being as wilfully stupid as Francis Collins). He hauls out the old atheism-is-faith-based-too chestnut, because after all, nobody can <i><i>prove</i></i> God doesn't exist, so if that's what you believe you're just taking it on blind <i><i>faith</i></i><span style="">, right? (Of course, nobody can prove that omnipotent purple hamsters <span style="font-style: italic;">aren't</span> partying it up in the Pleiades either; I guess Collins must believe in those too, or he'd be just as blind </span><span style="">as the creationists.) <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">He quotes Hawking's </span><i><i style=""><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Brief History of Time</span></i></i><span style="" lang="EN-CA"> out of context, in a way that portrays ol' Wheels as a believer; he makes no mention of Hawking's explicit denial of religious belief in the same book. He tries to tell us that creationism and Intelligent design are different things, and goes so far as to state as a scientist that the ID movement "deserves serious consideration" — evidently unaware that the IDiots got caught passing their creationist textbook through a global search-and-replace to turn every instance of the word "creationism" into "intelligent design", as a way to get around legal proscriptions against religion in science class.</span><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">I don't care if this guy <i><i>did</i></i> nail the gene for cystic fibrosis. If this book exemplifies his cognitive skills, I gotta wonder who he slept with to end up running the HGP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Once, many years ago, Francis Collins claims he was an athiest. Maybe he still is, at heart. Maybe he's just lying through his teeth with this book. Maybe he's a player with an agenda, a guy who wanted to climb up the ranks and figured that atheism would keep him off the guest lists for all the best parties. I have no evidence of this, but I hope that's the case. I hope that he's merely an opportunist. I really do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Because judging by this self-righteous, irrational, and contemptible book, the only other explanation that comes to mind is that Dr. Francis Collins is a fucking moron.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">(edited for style 22/12/07)</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><br><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);font-size:85%;">*Okay, maybe Lewis didn't use this particular example.
