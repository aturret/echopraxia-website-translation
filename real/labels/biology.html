    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Most of you probably know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>:  hypothetical gizmos built of paper punch-tape, read-write heads, and imagination, which can — step by laborious step — emulate the operation of any computer.  And some of you may be old enough to remember the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_ZX80">Sinclair ZX-80</a>— a sad little personal computer so primitive that it couldn't even run its video display and its keyboard at the same time (typing would cause the screen to go dark).  Peer into the darkness between these artifacts, stir in a little DNA, and what do you get?<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/250px-Portia.fimbriata.male.-.tanikawa-744907.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 160px;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/250px-Portia.fimbriata.male.-.tanikawa-744904.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br><br>This hairy little spider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Portia.fimbriata.male.-.tanikawa.jpg">right here</a>.  A pinpoint brain with less than a million neurons, somehow capable of mammalian-level problem-solving.  And just maybe, a whole new approach to cognition.<br><br><a href="..\articles\Sinclair ZX80 spiders.html">This</a> is an old story, and a popsci one, although I've only discovered it now (with thanks to Sheila Miguez) in a 2006 issue of <i>New Scientist</i>.  I haven't been able to find any subsequent reports of this work in the primary lit.   So take it with a grain of salt;  as far as I know, the peer-reviewers haven't got their talons into it yet. But holy shit, if this pans out…<br><br>Here's the thumbnail sketch:  we have here a spider who eats other spiders, who changes her foraging strategy on the fly, who resorts to trial and error techniques to lure prey into range.  She will brave a full frontal assault against prey carrying an egg sac, but sneak up upon an unencumbered target of the same species.  Many insects and arachnids are known for fairly complex behaviors (bumblebees are the proletarian's archetype; <i>Sphex</i> wasps are the cool grad-school example), but those behaviors are hardwired and inflexible.  <i>Portia</i> here is not so rote:  <i>Portia</i> <i>improvises</i>.<br><br>But it's not just this flexible behavioral repertoire that's so amazing.  It's not the fact that somehow, this dumb little spider with its crude compound optics has visual acuity to rival a cat's (even though a cat's got orders of magnitude more neurons in one retina than our spider has in her whole damn head).  It's not even the fact that this little beast can figure out a maze which entails recognizing prey, then figuring out an approach path along which that prey is not  visible (<i>i.e.,</i> the spider can't just keep her eyes on the ball:  she has to develop and remember a search image), then follow her best-laid plans by memory <i>including recognizing when she's made a wrong turn and retracing her steps, all the while out of sight of her target</i>.  No, the <i>really</i> amazing thing is how she does all this with a measly 600,000 neurons— how she pulls off cognitive feats that would challenge a mammal with seventy <i>million</i> or more.<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/spidermaze-752956.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 230px; height: 320px;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/spidermaze-752954.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>She does it like a Turing Machine, one laborious step at a time.  She does it like a Sinclair ZX-80: running one part of the system then another, because she doesn't have the circuitry to run both at once.  She does it all sequentially, by <i>timesharing</i>.<br><br>She'll sit there for two fucking hours, just watching.  It takes that long to process the image, you see:  whereas a cat or a mouse would assimilate the whole hi-res vista in an instant, <i>Portia</i>'s poor underpowered graphics driver can only hold a fraction of the scene at any given time.  So she scans, back and forth, back and forth, like some kind of hairy multilimbed Cylon centurion, scanning each little segment of the game board in turn.  Then, when she synthesizes the relevant aspects of each (God knows how many variables she's juggling, how many pencil sketches get scribbled onto the scratch pad because the jpeg won't fit), she figures out a plan, and puts it into motion:  climbing down the branch, falling out of sight of the target, ignoring other branches that would only <i>seem</i> to provide a more direct route to payoff, homing in on that one critical fork in the road that leads back up to satiation. <i>Portia</i> won't be deterred by the fact that she only has a few percent of a real brain: she <i>emulates</i> the brain she needs, a few percent at a time.<br><br>I wonder what the limits are to <i>Portia</i>'s painstaking intellect. Suppose we protected her from predators<sup><a name="Portiacite" href="#Portianote">1</a></sup>, and hooked her up to a teensy spider-sized glucose drip so she wouldn't starve. It takes her a couple of hours to capture a snapshot; how long will it take the fuzzy-legged little beauty to compose a sonnet?<br><br>Are we looking at a whole new kind of piecemeal, modular intellect here?  And why the hell didn't I think of it first?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 9/1/08:</span>  Tarsitano &amp; Jackson published <a href="..\articles\Tarsitano and Jackson - Spider selects detour routes.html">these results</a> in <span style="font-style: italic;">Animal Behaviour.  </span>Thanks to Kniffler for the heads-up<br><br><br><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><sup><a name="Portianote" href="#Portiacite">1</a></sup> And isn't <i>that</i> a whole other interesting problem, how this little beast can sit contemplating her pedipalps for hours on end in a world filled with spider-eating predators? Do certain antipredator reflexes stay active no matter what, or does she just count on immobility and local cover to hide her ass while she's preoccupied with long-term planning?  I'd love to see the cost-benefit of this tradeoff.</span></span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Portia</span> photo: by Akio Tanikawa, scammed from Wikipedia under a CC licence.<br>Maze illo: scammed from <span style="font-style: italic;">New Scientist</span>, under a nine-tenths-of-the-law licence.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/sentience__cognition.html">sentience/cognition</a></p>

It doesn't even need the <i>sun</i>. This fucker basically lives on sulfur, rock, and electrons*.<br><br>It's an obligate anaerobe, without even the most rudimentary oxygen resistance. A bug like βehemoth would kick its ass throughout most of the terrestrial biosphere (its natural digs are a couple of kilometers down in the crust, where no O<sub>2</sub> has poked its corrosive little head for at least three million years).  But that's not likely to be any kind of drawback out in space, and various talking heads are already <a href="http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn14906-goldmine-bug-dna-may-be-key-to-alien-life.html?feedId=space_rss20">nattering excitedly</a> about the prospect of something just like this hanging out on Mars, or on the Saturnian moons.<br><br>It <i>is</i> cool.  It is, quite literally, a complete ecosystem bundled into a single species, a biosphere crammed into two-and-a-half megabytes and a crunchy shell.   Astrobiologists the world over have been creaming their genes for a week now.  It's such a science-fictional little beast that its very name was lifted from a Jules Verne novel— but what really sticks in my mind about this little Swiss-army knife is a feature that's actually pretty common down there.<br><br>If it's anything like other deep-rock dwellers, <i>D. audaxviator</i>  reproduces very slowly, taking centuries or even millennia to double in numbers. It's a consequence of nutrient limitation, but might we be looking at a kind of incipient immortality here?  The textbooks tell us that one of the defining characteristics of life is <i>reproduction</i>.  But if you think of life as the propagation of organized information into the future — the <i>persistence</i> of signal, rather than merely its proliferation — then reproduction is really just a workaround. The chassis that carries the information wears out, and must be replaced.<br><br>It doesn't take much, here at the dawn of Synthetic Biology, to imagine an organism with unlimited self-repair capabilities;  something that can keep its telomeres nice and long, which sweeps away all those nasty free radicals and picks up the broken bottles in their wake, which replaces an endless succession of disposable Swatches with a solid gold Rolex which can hang in there for a billion years or more.  Hell, you could even postulate some kind of Lamarckian autoedit option on the genes, so the organism can adapt to new environments.  Or you could just limit your organism to extremely stable environments that don't <i>require</i> ongoing adaptation.  Interstellar space, for example.  Or deep in a planetary lithosphere.  In some ways, this could be a superior strategy to conventional breeding; at least you wouldn't have to worry about population explosions.<br><br>I wonder if, somewhere down there, <i>D. audaxviator</i> or something like it has given up on reproduction entirely.  Maybe it keeps the machinery around as a kind of legacy app that no one uses any more and just ticks slowly onwards, buried beneath all that insulating and protective rock, unto the very end of the planet.<br><br>The textbooks would call it dead.

	 In Praise of MPD
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>This month's <i>New Scientist</i> carries an <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19726476.300-perspectives-the-flip-side-to-multiple-personalities.html?feedId=being-human_rss20">opinion piece</a> by Rita Carter, author of the imminent <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Multiplicity-Science-Personality-Identity-Self/dp/031611538X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205516263&sr=1-1">Multiplicity:  The New Science of Personality</a></i>.  She's not the first to argue that multiple personalities may be adaptive (the whole backbone of the eighties' MPD fad was that they served to protect the primary persona from the stress of extreme abuse), nor is she the first to point out that MPD is just one end of a scale that goes all the way down to jes' plain folks adopting different faces for different social contexts (what Carter calls "normal multiplicity").  She does, however, suggest that "normal multiplicity could prove useful in helping people function in an increasingly complex world"; which raises the possibility that what we now think of as "pathological" multiplicity might prove useful in a <i>hyper</i>complex world.<br><br>Cue the Gang of Four.<br><br>This is one of the themes introduced in <i>Blindsight</i> that I'm going to town on with <i>Dumbspeech</i> (okay, okay:  <i>State of Grace</i>):  that humanity is, in effect, splitting into a whole suite of specialized cognitive subspecies as a means of dealing with information overload. (You can see the rudiments of this in the high proportion of Aspies hanging out in Silicon Valley, perhaps.)  But I've never encountered this Carter person before. Judging by her brief essay, I can't tell whether she's actually on to something or whether she's just putting neurogloss lipstick on the trivially obvious fact that it makes sense to behave differently in different situations (rather like making the Atkins Diet sound all high-tech and futuristic by describing it as "hacking the body").<br><br>Anyone here read her books?  Are they any good?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/blindsight.html">blindsight</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a></p>

	 Mind Reading Technology...
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>...has been a staple of every low-budget piece of celluloid skiffy going back at least to that early-sixties Gerry-Anderson puppet show <i>Stingray</i> (which no one with any dignity will admit to having watched, although I clearly remember the episode with the mind-reading chair).  <i>The Prisoner</i> also featured an episode in which No. 6's dreams could be probed, and the various incarnations of <i>Star Trek</i> must have had a half-dozen such episodes among them although they all seem to run together after awhile (the episode I'm thinking of had aliens with bumpy foreheads; does that help at all?).<br><br>Now here comes Kendrick Kay and his buddies in <i>Nature</i> with "<a href="http://rifters.com/real/articles/Identifying_natural_images_from_human_brain_activity.pdf">Identifying natural images from human brain activity</a>", and if they haven't actually vindicated all those cheesy narrative gimmicks, they've made a damn good first pass at it.  They used fMRI scans to infer which one of 120 possible novel images a subject was looking at.  "Novel" is important:  the system trained up front on a set of nearly 2,000 images to localize the receptive fields, but none of those were used in the actual mind-reading test.  So we're not talking about simply recognizing a simple replay of a previously-recorded pattern here.  Also, the images were <i>natural</i>— landscapes and still-lifes and snuff porn, none of this simplified star/circle/wavey-lines bullshit.  <br><br>The system looked into the minds of its subjects, and figured out what they were looking at with accuracies ranging from 32% to 92%.  While the lower end of that range may not look especially impressive, remember that random chance would yield an accuracy of 0.8%.  These guys are on to something.<br><br>Of course, they're not there yet.  The machine only had 120 pictures to choose from; tagging a card from a known deck is a lot easier than identifying an image you've never seen before.  But Kay <i>et al</i> are already at work on that; they conclude "it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person’s visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone."  And in a recent <a href="http://media.nature.com/download/nature/nature/podcast/v452/n7183/nature-2008-03-06.mp3">interview</a> Kay went further, suggesting that a few decades down the road, we'll have machines that can read <i>dreams</i>.<br><br>He was good enough to mention that we might want to look into certain privacy issues before that happens...<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/relevant tech.html">relevant tech</a></p>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The long-awaited new <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/247/description#description"><i>Neuropsychologia</i></a>'s finally on the stands, and it's a theme issue on — wait for it — <i>consciousness</i>!  Lots of articles on blindsight, interhemispheric signaling, anosognosia, all that cool stuff.  And nestled in the heart of this month's episode is a paper by David Rosenthal entitled "<a href="http://rifters.com/real/articles/Neuropsychologia_Rosenthal_2008.pdf">Consciousness and its function</a>".<br><br>Guess what.  He doesn't think it <i>has</i> any.<br><br>From the abstract:<br><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote>"...a number of suggestions are current about how the consciousness of those states may be useful ... I examine these and related proposals in the light of various empirical findings and theoretical considerations and conclude that the consciousness of cognitive and desiderative states is unlikely to be useful in these or related ways. This undermines a reliance on evolutionary selection pressures in explaining why such states so often occur consciously in humans."</blockquote></div>Rosenthal's conclusion? Consciousness is just a side-effect, with no real adaptive value.  And no, he didn't cite <i>Blindsight</i>.  But we all know I went there first.<br><br>Somewhere else I went, back in 1991, has been making a few online waves over the past week or two: this brief <a href="http://rifters.com/real/articles/Science_Christner_et_al_2008.pdf"><i>Science </i>article</a> by Christner <i>et al</i>, suggesting that microbes play a major and hitherto-unsuspected role in shaping the world's weather.  As Jeremy Ruhland <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2008/02/law-order-victims-of-reality-unit.html">pointed out</a> a few days back, this is a wee bit reminiscent of a <a href="http://rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_Nimbus.pdf">story</a> I wrote in the early nineties — a post-environmental-apocalypse number in which vast colonies of cloud-dwelling weathermongering microbes had conspired to kick our asses.  For a few years now I've been showing this slide whenever I want to make the point that sometimes you can hit the bullseye even when you have no fucking clue what you're talking about...<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/york13-743073.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/york13-742994.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br>... because really, "Nimbus" was a spontaneous, unresearched brain fart based entirely on an old girlfriend's observation that "Ooh, look at those clouds... they almost look <i>alive</i>!"  But CNN is not exactly the most prestigious source of scientific intel on the planet, and besides, Moffet was just starting to look back in 2002; he hadn't actually found anything<i>.</i>  That was then; this is now.  You can't get more prestigious than <i>Science</i> (well, unless you're <i>Nature</i>), and now we're looking at actual data.<br><br>Of course, this is nowhere near the cozy conjunction of Watts and Rosenthal.  Christner <i>et al</i>. didn't even look at clouds <i>per sé</i>, only at the precipitation that had dropped out of them. And it's not like they discovered any new and alien microbes; mostly they came up with plant pathogens. (Also, my microbe-infested clouds had a kind of slow intelligence to them — and if we ever get any evidence supporting that conceit I'll eat my cats.)  But what they did show was that microbes affect the weather— and at the very least, that leaves the door open for all sorts of evil, powerful, yet-to-be-discovered bugs lurking overhead.<br><br>I like that thought.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/blindsight.html">blindsight</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/science.html">science</a></p>

It's a breakthrough, a miracle — until a couple of statisticians from John Hopkins publish an analysis proving that the effect is pure placebo.  Our patient reads the study.  Within a month, he's circling the drain.  Within two, he's dead.<br><br>The next of kin charge the authors of the paper, and the journal that published them, with negligent homicide.<br><br>Placebos <i>work</i>, you see.  The brain can do all sorts of things to the body; sometimes it just needs to be tricked into generating the right happy chemicals.  Medical professionals know as much: it may not be the cure so much as the <i>belief</i> in the cure that does the trick, and when you shatter that belief, you are knowingly stealing hope and health from every patient who heeds your words.  You are, in a very real sense, killing them.<br><br>Do we have here a legitimate argument for the perpetuation of ignorance?  Medical professionals do not generally discourage the use of prayer in dire circumstance.  It does no harm, after all.  (Actually there's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/31pray.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin">some evidence</a> that it <i>does</i> do harm; let's set that aside for the moment.)  But when you <i>know</i> that placebo effects are real, and you go out of your way to disillusion some deluded flake who shows up on the ward convinced that her crystals and magnets will keep the tumors at bay... well, maybe education of the sick should be a criminal offense.<br><br>I'm just saying.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a></p>

	 Cancer, For the Greater Good
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/vlcsnap-3840312-799305.png"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/vlcsnap-3840312-799300.png" border="0" alt=""></a>One of my favorite monster movies of all time has got to be John Carpenter's 1982 remake of “The Thing”.  It's not a perfect film by any means – there are some gaffes with the rubber fx, and if eighties-era PCs ever came preloaded with software to test whether your buddies had been taken over by shapeshifting aliens, I never saw it.  (A shame.  Back then I would've bought something like that in a second.  These days, it's pretty much redundant.)  Still, “The Thing” is one of the few movies of its type in which the Human cast isn't as dumb as a sack of Huckabees.  Nobody wanders off after the ship's cat <span style="font-style:italic;">all by themselves</span>.  The moment they figure out what they're up against they burn everything that moves, start thinking about serological detection methods, and keep <span style="font-style:italic;">really</span> close watch on each other.  It's an effective study in paranoia, starring an alien that not only squirts slime and sprouts tentacles, but actually proves to be quite a bit more intelligent than the humans it preys upon.  (As one might expect from a creature with interstellar technology.  Am I the only one bothered by the fact that the monster in the Howard Hawkes original never did anything smarter than just kinda flailing around and roaring?)  Even at the scorched-earth end of the story, you're never really sure who won.<br><br>Then there's the biology.<br><br>It's actually not as totally whacked-out as you may think.  Granted, anything able to morph between body plans in the time it takes me to snarf an Egg McMuffin would have to have stores of cellular energy verging on the nuclear.  (Jeff Goldblum's gradual, donut-powered transformation in “The Fly” was a lot more believable  –  although why those telepods got all confused at the presence of fly DNA, when they didn't seem to bat a diode at the bacteria seething on every square micron of both fly and human, remains an open question.  But I digress.)  Still, if you can forgive the ridiculously fast transformation, the idea of an infectious agent retooling infected cells for its own purposes is old news.  Viruses have been doing it for billions on years.<br><br>Now we are too.  Synthetic Life's current rock star, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter">J. Craig Venter</a>, is all over the lit with his artifical chromosomes and Swiss-Army cells:  build a cellular chassis that carries the basic instruction set necessary for metabolism, and then top it off with genes to produce whatever you're after this week.  Before long, Venter's Vats (and only Venter's vats, if <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/venters-patent.html">the patents</a> go through) will be churning out great masses of everything from Nutripon to Biogasoline. <br><br>But more interesting, to me, is <a href="http://compbiol.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030250">this recent paper</a> out of PloS Computational Biology on “Somatic Evolution”&mdash; i.e., the classic Darwinian struggle for existence among the cells of  a single tissue in a single organism.  And why <span style="font-style:italic;">shouldn't</span> the rules of natural selection apply to cells as well as their owners?  The cells in your liver exist in a habitat with limited food, just like populations of multicellular creatures.  They jostle up against others like themselves who have their eye on the same nutrients.  Given a mutation that allowed one such cell to outcompete its siblings &mdash; faster reproductive rate, lower mortality &mdash; wouldn't its offspring kick the asses of the competition?  Wouldn't the whole tissue, the whole organ, <span style="font-style:italic;">evolve</span> into something new, something where every cell was out for itself, something like &mdash;<br><br>&mdash;Well, cancer, obviously.<br><br>Don't bother pointing out the obvious.  Yes, if our cells did follow the beat of their own drummer, multicellularity would never have evolved in the first place.  But that's circular; there's nothing in the rules that says multicellularity had to evolve, and logically Darwin's hand should be felt down in the  blood as well as out on the savannah.  Something must have suppressed those processes at the cellular level before metazoans could arise; that's what this paper is about.<br>  <br>But now I'm thinking on a tangent.  I remember our old friends the scramblers, and how it was possible for them to evolve without genes: <br><blockquote>"I'd swear half the immune system is actively targetting the other half. It's not just the immune system, either. Parts of the nervous system seem to be trying to, well, hack each other. I think they evolve intraorganismally, as insane as that sounds. The whole organism's at war with itself on the tissue level, it's got some kind of cellular Red Queen thing happening. Like setting up a colony of interacting tumors, and counting on fierce competition to keep any one of them from getting out of hand. Seems to serve the same role as sex and mutation does for us."</blockquote><br>And I remember MacReady in Carpenter's film, after Norris split into several different pieces to keep from burning alive, internalising the take-home lesson:<br><blockquote><br>"Every part of him was a whole.  Every little piece was an individual animal with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  Y'see, when a man bleeds... it's just tissue.  But blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked.  It'll try and survive.  Crawl away from a hot needle, say..."</blockquote><br>Cancer, for the greater good.<br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/vlcsnap-3846194-793704.png"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://rifters.com/real/uploaded_images/vlcsnap-3846194-793699.png" border="0" alt=""></a>Maybe that's where people and scramblers and MacReady-battling Things went their separate ways.  We tamed our inner battles using stem cells and transient cells and differentiated tissues, just like Pepper <span style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span> hypothesise.  But maybe other worlds spawned other answers.  Maybe whatever alien slime mold gave rise to our Antarctic shapeshifter decided to go with the whole cell-competition thing, decided to make it a solution instead of a problem.  Maybe that's how all those cells remain totipotent even in the adult animal; or maybe some tentacle-whipping alien J. Craig Venter just figured out how to go back and retrofit his species for optimal adaptability and maximum profit.  Of course they could do it, even if they didn't evolve that way.  They built flying saucers, for Chrissakes.  They were crossing the interstellar gulf before we'd even made it out of Africa.  What better failsafe for lost and stranded travellers than to be able to take your cue from the natives, slip into a new body precustomised for its environment?<br><br>I read “Who Goes There” back in the eighties, decades after John W. Campbell wrote it and about six months before Carpenter's unjustly-maligned remake hit the theatres.  I thought it was tres cool from the outset.  But it never occurred to me to write a sequel until I read this paper...<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/evolution.html">evolution</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/ink on art.html">ink on art</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a></p>

(Current opinion, at the ¼ mark:<span style="">  </span>this guy is the Harriet Miers of gel jocks.<span style="">  </span>How the hell can a top-flight geneticist be so abysmally ill-informed about basic biology? How can he be so utterly unfamiliar with basic <i><i>logic</i></i>?).<span style="">  </span><br></p><p class="MsoBodyText">But it's fucking Christmastime, don't you know, and the obligations of this season eat at one's waking hours like a cancer.<span style="">  </span>And I have four or five pitches/outlines, all in various states of (in)completion, that I gotta get done before my new agent writes me off for dead and eaten by cats.<span style="">  </span>So for now, I'll just hand off with another excerpt from the imminent Szeman/Whiteman interview " Wildlife, Natural and Artificial:<span style="">  </span>An Interview with Peter Watts ":</p>  <p class="MsoList"></p><blockquote><i style=""><br><i>IS/MW: Dark, troubled, disturbed, heroic: Lenie Clark is one of the great characters of contemporary science fiction writing. A sympathetic protagonist despite her outward coldness—and the fact that her rage at the Grid Authority leads her to seed βehemoth across North America. Ken Lubin, too: a character about whom we know almost nothing beyond his capacity to expertly assess situations and to act on the results, but whom readers nevertheless see as on their side against the threats of the world. How did you come to create Lenie? What are the special challenges (if </i>any) of writing about characters like these? </i>  <br><p class="MsoList">PW: Lenie Clarke was my attempt to imagine what was going on inside a woman I was briefly involved with back in grad school. It was one of those relationships that lasts maybe two months, tops, tosses you around like a pebble in a cement mixer full of broken glass, and then spits you out in the certain knowledge you’ll never see your partner again. You know all this going in, of course. You know the relationship has no future. And you do it anyway, because hey: what does have a future, these days? And at least you know you’re alive in the meantime.</p><p class="MsoList">The special challenge, of course, is that I probably got her completely wrong. But I rather suspect she’s been dead for some time, so she’s not likely to contradict me. And other people, who hail from similarly dark places, tell me that Lenie feels real to them. This honours me. I haven’t been fucked over nearly as much as these people have, I’m basically a pampered poser playing let’s-pretend-we’ve-been-sexually-abused. But if my prose can convince people who’ve actually been there, that’s something.</p> <p class="MsoList">Unless, of course, they were just sucking up to me. That happens too. Not as much as it should, sadly.<br></p></blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText">The whole interview (which I've previously excerpted <a href="..\newscrawl.htm">here</a>, when I was first muddling through the questions — just scroll down to April 5) weighs in at well over 7,000 words and is slated to appear in the journal <i><i>Extrapolation</i></i> 48(3): 603-619.<span style="">  </span>(And I mean <i><i>really</i></i> appear, which is not so common as I might have expected.<span style="">  </span>Regular visitors may remember my mention of extensive interviews with the likes of <i><i>Locus</i></i> and the online editions of <i><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></i>, way back in spring/summer of this year.<span style="">  </span>Don't know what's up with those, but I grow increasingly skeptical of either's appearance.)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/misc.html">misc</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/writing news.html">writing news</a></p>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Being the selection of a recent science item, hitherto unreported on this 'crawl, most near and dear to my heart.<br><br>Oddly, most of the items I've noticed recently seem reminiscent of my second book <i>Maelstrom</i> &mdash; from this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/technology/techspecial/12threat.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin">tell-us-something-we-<i>don't</i>-know piece</a> in the NY Times about the increasing fragility of complex technological systems to Naomi Klein's new book "<a href="http://www.naomiklein.org/main">The Shock Doctrine</a>".  Squinting at the news I can almost see the Complex Systems Instability-Response Authority gestating in the bowels of Halliburton; reading Klein's take on "disaster capitalism" I'm reminded of Marq Qammen's rant to Lenie Clarke about Adaptive Shatter:  "...When damage control started accounting for more of the GGP than the production of new goods."  <i>Starfish</i> may have been a more immersive novel;  <i>Blindsight</i> may have had chewier ideas.  But <i>Maelstrom</i>, I think, is way out front in terms of decent extrapolation.<br><br>Or there's this <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,1,5376455.story?ctrack=1&cset=true">too-good-to-pass-up story</a> out of <i>Nature Neuroscience</i> by way of the LA Times, in which a study combining button-pushing with the letters "M" and "W" showed that liberals are better at parsing novel input than conservatives, who have a greater tendency to fall into inflexible knee-jerk behaviors.  (This would tend to explain, for example, how the inability to change one's mind in the face of new input can be regarded as a strength &mdash; "strong leadership" &mdash; while the ability to accommodate new information is regarded as "flip-flopping".)  (Surprisingly, these findings have <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGZhNThhYmZlNTA5ODE1MTM0MTdmZjhjZWY4Y2Q5OWE=">not been embraced</a> by those who describe themselves as right-wing.) <br><br>But today's Skiffy has to go to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/aug/30/3">this story</a> in the Guardian, simply because it reflects so many facets of my own life (such as it is):  marine mammals (in particular harbour porpoises, upon which I did my M.Sc.) are being infected by the mind-affecting parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (whose genes were a vital part of "Guilt Trip" from the rifters novels, and which has been cited in this very crawl &mdash; <a href="..\newscrawl_2005-1.htm">May 6 2005</a>) contacted from household cats (of which whose connection to mine own life you should all be aware by now).<br><br>Marine Mammals.

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>New to me, old to the lit:  a paper in <i>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</i>, which came out last November (just a month after <i>Blindsight</i> was released): "<a href="..\articles\TCS_Koch_and_Tsuchiya_2006.html">Attention and consciousness:  two distinct brain processes</a>".  <br><br>Let me cherry-pick a few choice excerpts:  "The close relationship between attention and consciousness has led many scholars to conflate these processes." ... "This article ... argu[es] that top-down attention and consciousness are distinct phenomena that need not occur together" ...  "events or objects can be attended to without being consciously perceived."<br><br><i>Yes</i>, part of me shouts in vindication, while the rest of me whispers <i>Oh your god, please no.</i><br><br>It's a review article, not original research.  As such it cites some of the same studies and examples I drew on while writing <i>Blindsight</i>.  But what especially interested me was the suggestion of <i>mechanism</i> behind some of those results.  Both <i>Blindsight</i> and Blog cite studies showing that being distracted from a problem actually improves your decision-making skills, or that we are paradoxically better at detecting subtle stimuli in "noisy" environments than in "clean" ones.  Koch and Tsuchiya cite a paper that describes this as a form of <i>competition between neuron clusters</i>:<br><blockquote>"attention acts as a winner-takes-all, enhancing one coalition of neurons (representing the attended object) at the expense of others (non-attended stimuli). Paradoxically, reducing attention can enhance awareness and certain behaviors." </blockquote><br>I like this.  It's almost <i>ecological</i>.  Predators increase the diversity of their own prey species by keeping the most productive ones in check;  remove the starfish from a multispecies intertidal assemblage and the whole neighborhood turns to mussels inside a month.  This is the same sort of thing (except it happens within a single brain and therefore tastes more of Lamarck than Darwin).  Different functional clusters (the different prey species) duke it out for attention, each containing legitimate data about the environment&mdash; but only the winner (i.e., the mussels) gets to tell its tale to the pointy-haired boss.  All that other data just gets <i>lost</i>.   And the static that paradoxically improves performance in such cases &mdash;  white noise, or irrelevant anagrams that steal one's focus &mdash; play the role of the predator, reducing the advantage of the front-runner so that subordinate subroutines can get their voices heard.<br><br>I wonder. If we trained ourselves to live in a state of constant self-imposed distraction, could we <i>desentientise</i> our own brains...?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/just putting it out there....html">just putting it out there...</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/neuro.html">neuro</a></p>

First they changed one microbe species into another by physically <a href="http://rifters.com/real/articles/Science_GenomeTransplantation.pdf">replacing its entire genome</a>.  They did this in their quest to create a synthetic organism, basically a chassis with the absolute minimum number of genes necessary for life, which could then be loaded up with other customized genes designed to act for <s>the betterment of humanity and the environment</s> the good of Venter stockholders. Now they've discovered that Nature herself has done them one better, by incorporating the complete genome of a parasitic bacterium called <i>Wolbachia</i> into the code of fruit flies: two complete genotypes for the price of one (original article <a href="..\articles\Science_Wolbachia.html">here</a>: much more accessible press release over <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=2963">here</a>).<br><br>Some of you may remember &szlig;ehemoth, from the rifters books:  it was basically mitochondrion's nasty cousin, and like mitochondria it brought its own genome into the host cell.  This is a big step further: <i>Wolbachia</i>'s code isn't just hanging out in the cell, it's been incorporated into the nuclear DNA of the host itself.  The host is not <i>infected</i> with Wolbachia; there are no bacteria cruising the cytoplasm.  Rather, the complete recipe for building the bug has been spliced into the host's code— and since the odds of such a big chunk of data (over a megabyte) getting thus incorporated without playing <i>any</i> functional role are pretty small, chances are that this embedded genotype is doing something for the host organism.  <i>This</i> is assimilation:  the dicks of Borg drones everywhere should be shriveling with collective performance anxiety.<br><br>Two major implications come immediately to mind.  The first is that conventionally-derived genotypes sequenced to date might be all washed up, since bacterial DNA is routinely scrubbed from such results as "contamination"; but if this new phenomenon is widespread (and <i>Wolbachia</i> is one of the world's most abundant parasites of invertebrates), a lot of the bathwater we've been throwing out might actually <i>be</i> the baby.  And the second implication, well &mdash;<br><br>Anyone remember David Cronenberg's remake of "The Fly"...?<br><br>(Illo credit, as far as I can tell, goes to the University of Rochester.)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/evolution.html">evolution</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/science.html">science</a></p>

There are martial and economic possibilities, too.<span style="">  </span>I can see Homeland Security getting involved.<span style="">  </span>I can see national policies increasingly based on insights gleaned from fantasy simulations — and I can see such policies being played from the inside, by mages and blood elves who might have their own agendas to pursue...</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Damn. The story almost writes itself. </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/a-life.html">a-life</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/biology.html">biology</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://rifters.com/real/labels/science.html">science</a></p>
