Oh, look, here's a scientist called Francis Collins. He is much smarter, more prominent, and way better-paid than I ever was. He says I'm wrong. He says he has evidence for the existence of the Christian God. He uses many scientific-sounding words to convince me he might be on to something.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt; color: rgb(255, 255, 51);"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><blockquote style="color: rgb(255, 255, 51);">Teach me, Francis Collins, Director of the Human Genome Project, arch-nemesis of the evil Craig Venter!

Dr. Francis Collins' Big Reveal. Actually, his Big Reveal was a personal epiphany he had while looking at a bunch of icicles; this is his Evidence That Demands A Verdict, and it is, wait for it:<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt; text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The warm fuzzy feeling you get when you "Do The Right Thing".</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Yup. That's it.<span style=""> </span>A dopamine rush, elevated to the status of "The Moral Law". Universally extant in every Human culture, he says, and unique to Human culture as well. "Evolution will never explain The Moral Law and the Universal Search for God", he assures us,  will never explain that uniquely, universally human urge to help those in need,  even if they don't share our genes, even at our own expense.  We are beyond evolution — for if the evolutionists were right, we'd never do anything except selfishly try to spread our own genes.<span style=""> </span>Collins actually uses the word "scandal" to describe the way in which we "evolutionists" regard altruism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">He invokes C.S. Lewis's faux-adaptationist argument to induce God's existence from these warm fuzzies: <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><blockquote>"Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger; well, there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim; well, there is such a thing as water. Pedophiles feel sexual desire; well, there is such a thing as alter boys*. If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world."</blockquote><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">After which Collins cuts in and asks "Why do we have a 'God-shaped vacuum' in our hearts unless it is meant to be filled?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Where to start. (Beyond noting that while some sort of vacuum does seem to persist in one Francis Collins, it is unlikely to reside in his thorax...) <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Let's start with a general observation. Collins' understanding of natural selection appears to be a woefully-ignorant caricature in which every organism always behaves optimally to promote its own fitness, and every instance in which this doesn't happen constitutes a failure of evolutionary theory calling out for Divine intervention. What he doesn't seem to understand (or perhaps, what he's hoping you won't) is that the whole basis of natural selection is <i><i>variation</i></i>. Organisms differ; some do better than others; the losers leave fewer offspring. Nature, in other words, is chock-full of creatures who do not selfishly spread their genes, who benefit others at their own expense. Conspecifics might call such organisms "unsuccessful competitors". Parasites would call them "hosts". Predators would call them "food". The Archdiocese calls them "parishioners".<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Perhaps you're thinking that's a cheap shot; prey may not <span style="font-style: italic;">successfuly</span> spread their genes, but that's not for want of trying.  I would counter that the same could be said of all those good folks who turn the other cheek expecting a grand payoff in the Kingdom of Heaven.  Either way, this Collins guy needs to be taught the basics — not just of biology, but of elementary logic. To claim that non-selfish acts contradict evolutionary theory is like claiming that blow jobs contradict the orgasm's role in reproduction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">But fine: he's talking about the <i><i>knowing</i></i> and <i><i>voluntary</i></i> sacrifice of one's own interests to benefit another. <i><i>That's</i></i> what he defines as uniquely human. Except it isn't. Empathy for nonrelatives, efforts expended to help others (even members of different species), have been documented in nonhuman primates and cetaceans. The concepts of fair play and justice don't seem to be uniquely human either. Contrary to Collins' claims, sociobiologists don't have any real trouble reconciling such actions with evolutionary processes; in fact, the neurochemistry underlying empathy is a pretty basic social-cohesion mechanism.<span style="">   </span>And while Collins has a field day hauling out Oskar Schindler and Mother Theresa as examples of selfless service to a greater good, he's only cherry-picking one or two convenient outliers from a cloud of data. Readers of this obscure little newscrawl may remember that there <i><i>is</i></i> a data cloud, statistically quantifiable, and <a href="http://rifters.com/real/2007/08/selfish-bastards-every-one.html">it shows</a> that people tend to engage in risky heroics or acts of altruistic generosity primarily when it improves their chances of getting laid. (And don't bother pointing out that Mommy Theresa's chances of that were pretty much nil — we both know the basement circuitry works the same way regardless of motivational overlays.  Besides, she was expecting a whole other kind of payoff, just as Schindler more likely than not feared some kind of pay<span style="font-style: italic;">back</span>.)  You may also remember that this "Moral Law", such as it is, is inconsistent and often downright wrong, that the <i><i>truly</i></i> altruistic — those who'd unhesitatingly sacrifice two of their own children to save four of someone else's, for example — suffer from a specific and precise form of <a href="..\..\newscrawl_2007-2.htm#04-04-07">brain damage</a>. The truly moral are those with lesions in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; not, so far as I've heard, a "universal" aspect of the Human condition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">And that's not even getting into the self-sacrificing behaviour of those who have merely been tricked into furthering someone else's agenda.<span style="">   </span>How many Christians would have marched in the Crusades, how many jihadists would have strapped bombs across their bellies, how many missionaries would have risked disease and death in darkest Africa if they'd actually believed that eternal damnation was waiting at the end of it? (Now <i><i>that</i></i> would be altruism.) Is Collins really so blind to the workings of his own religion that he can't tell the difference between true selflessness and the manipulation of selfish motives by parasites wielding imaginary payoffs?<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Which leads to another, and mind-bogglingly obvious failing of Collins' argument: the ubiquity of the "Moral Law". His claim that we all share the same standards of right and wrong would, I expect, come as news to all those cultures throughout history who kept (and keep) slaves, who mutilate the genitals of their women, who regarded (and regard) foreign races, beliefs, and behaviours as things to be avoided at best and hammered into extinction at worst. The ongoing genocides of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries provide eloquent testimony to the ubiquity of Collins' Moral Law, and while he leaves himself a bit of wiggle room (we all have the Moral Law, you see, but some of us choose to <i><i>ignore</i></i> it), he cites nothing to justify the claim that this sense of right and wrong <i><i>is</i></i> universal beyond the one-two punch that a) <i><i>he</i></i> feels it and so do all his friends, and b) C.S. Lewis told him so. <span style=""> </span>(In fact, reading <span style="font-style: italic;">The Language of God</span>, you get the sense that Francis Collins has anointed himself C.S. Lewis's Official Corporeal Sock Puppet.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">For all his talk of agape and altruism, Collins may be the most profoundly self-centred human being I've read. The possibility that everyone doesn't feel just the way he does seems completely beyond his grasp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">The search for God? I'm a pretty introspective dude, and I can say with a high degree of confidence that I don't have anything like that gnawing away inside me. I recognise that many people do— but I also recognise that our brains are hardwired to see patterns even where none exist, to attribute agency even to purely indifferent phenomena.<span style="">  It's a small enough step from the "Theory of Mind" that allows us to suss out the agendas of the creatures and conspecifics we encounter day to day.   So the very </span>clouds can look angry to us, or benign; and who <i><i>hasn't</i></i> wanted to put a brick through that fucking laptop and its fucking Blue Screen of Death which always, malevolently, crashes your system when you're six hours from deadline and have forgotten to save? <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Apply equal parts ignorance, pattern-matching, and the attribution of motives onto nature's canvas: angels and demons sprout like Spears sprogs behind every rock (much as they appeared to Collins in his frozen waterfall). But Collins doesn’t even admit that such neural circuitry <i><i>exists</i></i>, much less contemplate its potential relevance to human superstition. No mention at all of <a href="http://www.shaktitechnology.com/">Persinger's</a> work, or <a href="http://psy.ucsd.edu/chip/ramabio.html">Ramachandran</a>'s. Not a word about the brain's God Module. And once again, no credit whatsoever to the guys with the mitres and crosses — not to mention the iron maidens in their basements —  and the role <i><i style="">they</i></i> might have played in inculcating a sense of the divine into the culture (albeit granted, a form of the Divine that seems chronically in need of alms).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">So Collins' central, most rigorous argument for a personal god — who created heaven and earth and made us and <i><i>only</i></i> us in his image — is that everybody shares the same sense of right and wrong (except they don't); that everybody seeks God (speak for yourself, buddy; I'm happy if I can just find a decent pint of Rickards); that Human beings are unique among all species in being altruistic and moral (except we're not); and that there's no other explanation but the God of Abraham for any of this (except there sure as shit <i><i>is</i></i>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Let me repeat: this is his <i><i>strongest</i></i> argument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">It's not his only one, though. Collins commits numerous other sins, easily recognised by anyone with even a passing familiarity with the moves of flat-earthers and climate-change deniers and spin-doctors the world over. Statements initially introduced with all the right caveats ("If we accept the possibility of the supernatural, then it is possible that...") reappear later, unsubstantiated but nonetheless miraculously transmuted into statements of absolute fact (believers are "right to hold fast to the eternal truths of the Bible"). Legitimate objections to his positions (e.g., that religious beliefs are irrelevant to the study of Nature) are dismissed for no better reason than that Collins finds them unpalatable ("that doesn't resonate with most individuals' human experience", he writes). In the manner of fundies everywhere, and in the spirit of that book he holds most holy, he contradicts himself whenever it suits him. At one point he argues against the God-as-wishful-thinking model by pointing out that a product of wish-fulfillment would be cuddly and indulgent, not demanding and judgmental as the God of Abraham is wont to be. (Oddly, the prospect of an intimidating God invoked not for comfort, but as a way for folks in funny hats to exert control over credulous followers, never seems to occur to him.) But when facing off against those who'd claim that God scattered photons and fossils across heaven and earth to test our faith, he decides that a little wishful thinking is just fine: "Would God as the great deceiver be an entity anyone would <i><i>want</i></i> to worship?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">He rejects a naturalistic universe because after all, something had to kick-start the Big Bang (it couldn't have just booted itself, that would be silly) — then changes the rules to exempt his own model from the same criticism (oh, nothing had to create God, God just booted Himself). (As I would too, hard in my own ass, if I'd created a sentient being as wilfully stupid as Francis Collins). He hauls out the old atheism-is-faith-based-too chestnut, because after all, nobody can <i><i>prove</i></i> God doesn't exist, so if that's what you believe you're just taking it on blind <i><i>faith</i></i><span style="">, right? (Of course, nobody can prove that omnipotent purple hamsters <span style="font-style: italic;">aren't</span> partying it up in the Pleiades either; I guess Collins must believe in those too, or he'd be just as blind </span><span style="">as the creationists.) <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">He quotes Hawking's </span><i><i style=""><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Brief History of Time</span></i></i><span style="" lang="EN-CA"> out of context, in a way that portrays ol' Wheels as a believer; he makes no mention of Hawking's explicit denial of religious belief in the same book. He tries to tell us that creationism and Intelligent design are different things, and goes so far as to state as a scientist that the ID movement "deserves serious consideration" — evidently unaware that the IDiots got caught passing their creationist textbook through a global search-and-replace to turn every instance of the word "creationism" into "intelligent design", as a way to get around legal proscriptions against religion in science class.</span><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">I don't care if this guy <i><i>did</i></i> nail the gene for cystic fibrosis. If this book exemplifies his cognitive skills, I gotta wonder who he slept with to end up running the HGP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Once, many years ago, Francis Collins claims he was an athiest. Maybe he still is, at heart. Maybe he's just lying through his teeth with this book. Maybe he's a player with an agenda, a guy who wanted to climb up the ranks and figured that atheism would keep him off the guest lists for all the best parties. I have no evidence of this, but I hope that's the case. I hope that he's merely an opportunist. I really do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Because judging by this self-righteous, irrational, and contemptible book, the only other explanation that comes to mind is that Dr. Francis Collins is a fucking moron.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">(edited for style 22/12/07)</span><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><br><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"> <o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span style="" lang="EN-CA"><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);font-size:85%;">*Okay, maybe Lewis didn't use this particular example.

        <p>Thanks for reading this, Peter, so I don't have to.

        <p>Actually, I think he may have been onto something, although not in the way he intended.<br><br>"Why do we have a "God-shaped vacuum" in our hearts..."<br><br>This is the interesting question. It's pretty clear to anyone who seriously thinks about it that the existence of God, or any supernatural being, is completely unsupported by facts or logic.<br><br>I don't think I'm going to have any trouble convincing the folks here of that.<br><br>But, if that's the case, then why does every society throughout human history believe in the supernatural (as far as I know)?<br><br>Seems odd, due to the fact that human beings are fairly smart animals in most other regards, and that such a huge belief in a patently false idea would seem to be a massive evolutionary <i>disadvantage</i>. Spending tens of thousands of years sacrificing virgins to the rain god instead of understanding the weather would be a bit of a handicap in making your way in the world.<br><br>So why are things this way? It seems like a trait that's so widely spread throughout the species - and so well conserved - would have some sort of adaptive advantage. <br><br>What is it?</p>

We know orders of magnitude more about the universe than we did even a generation ago; no matter how great the mind, it needs data to crunch, and for the vast majority of those 2000 years the data simply weren't available.  We may not be as smart as Newton, but we know a hell of a lot more than he did.

I'm told that Coulter has written a critique on evolution; but since the woman has no expertise in that subject, I know up front I'm not missing out on anything by giving it a miss. This Collins guy, on the other hand, has black-belt qualifications in certain areas of biology &mdash; and while MDs are notorious for having a generally poor grasp of evolutionary theory (evo/devo is not generally part of the medical curriculum), one would hope that a top-flight research geneticist would be an exception.  And, in fact, the dude <i>does</i> acknowledge the irrefutable reality of descent with modification.  He just goes completely off the rails when it comes to knowing the present state of evolutionary biology (or alternatively he lies about it &mdash; certainly, his misrepresentation of Stephen Hawking can't have been accidental.)

        <p>Dude, how's stuff? <br><br>Okay, yeah, I think it was a little harsh to call him a fucking moron.  If he's a decent scientist, he could be a asshole, perhaps, or a jerk, but probably not a moron.  He looked at a question, analyzed it in a way you find faulty, and came to conclusions with which you disagree.  I can't imagine that makes him a moron.<br><br>I'm not sure why you are comparing him to that conservative Ms Coulter.  She's not a scientist, and not after truth, she's a pundit.  Her bread and butter is spinning opinions for money; this is antithetical to the role of science, which it clarification and elucidation, going so far as to start with the null hypothesis.  Pundits definitely don't start there.<br><br>You have the right to your opinion, this being America for a few more minutes at least, and you have to right to call FC any name you like.

I just thought "fucking moron" was a little harsh.<br><br><i>So, yes: I would fully expect that recent expertise would make progress on issues that remained unresolved over previous centuries.  <br></i><br><br>I can't see that there is going to be some resolution of the problem "how do we determine the existence of an entity whose definition includes the property that it can do anything" any time soon.<br><br>Are you really of the opinion that this question is on the brink of solution?  I'm not being sarcastic, I'm interested. If so, why now? What makes you think we are near breakthrough hour?<br><br><i>By your reasoning, no new insights should be generated on any subject that "great minds" have puzzled over for more than thirty minutes.</i><br><br>Whoa, whoa there!  Oh no, of course not. That's hyperbole, I assume.  I mean that problems that people puzzle over for thousands of years are probably big damn problems, and need lots of thought, so the statistical probability that you or I are/am alive when the brilliant breakthrough appears are low.  Consider how long that Fermat thing took!  I think we are hundreds of years away, if not thousands, from any definite answer on G/nG.<br><br>Like the march to the cliff - for a large percentage of the walk things are proceding as you expect.  Eventually, *whoosh*, but the whoosh takes a second, the walk took 120+ minutes, so, proportionally ...<br><br><br><i>I was expecting a lot more.</i><br><br>Well, yeah, isn't that the way when you dive into someone's discussion of the G/nG thing?  You think, yeah, baby, yeah, it's gonna hit, this time I feel luckEH!  I'm just kind of tired of the same old discussion.  I mean, forget whether what FC said was in line with science, was it original?  That people have a moral sense => God goes back to THomas Aquinas, doesn't it?  Someone help me out here.  <br><br>Read Blindsight online; it was interesting.</p>

        <p><b>OpenID bec-87rb said...<br></b><i><br>    Okay, yeah, I think it was a little harsh to call him a fucking moron. If he's a decent scientist, he could be a asshole, perhaps, or a jerk, but probably not a moron.</i><br><br>Couple of points here: you gotta take my "moron" comment in light of the set-up.  I started a two-part posting by remarking that a lot of religious fundies are fucking morons, <i>then </i>by establishing a second group of religious types who were <i>not</i> morons.  I began by putting Collins firmly in the second group, by virtue of his presumed respect for the scientific method, and hoping to learn from him.  When he proved to have nothing worthwhile to say, I didn’t actually call him a moron;  I stated quite explicitly that I would rather regard him as a duplicitous opportunist and a liar, because the only <i>alternative</i>, given the two categories I had previously established, was fucking moronhood.<br><br>Obviously Collins is not a moron in the clinical sense of the word.  But how do we describe the kind of person he is?  Is he a liar and a hypocrite, using his authority to mislead the credulous?  Is he honestly misguided, does all that sophisticated analytical circuitry he uses in the course of his day-to-day research just shut down when it approaches religious issues? In the latter case, maybe he <i>is</i>, literally, mentally impaired in a way.  I don't know.<br><br>I just know that he presented no evidence for faith.  His arguments were familiar, slipshod, fallacious, and either ignorant or deliberately misleading.  Intelligent people could well buy into such arguments, if they were ignorant of basic evolutionary biology &mdash; as I said before, you need data as well as smarts.  I don't look down on anyone for believing absurdities about subjects in which they have no expertise, especially if such absurdities are presented by established authority figures.  Lacking data, I put a lot of faith in authorities; what's the alternative?<br><br>But this guy should know better.  He <i>is</i> an authority, and by presenting fantasy as fact he becomes dangerous and contemptible.  To show my contempt, I use words of contempt.  If I were a racist I might call him a nigger.  If I were a homophobe I might call him a faggot.  But I am a different kind of elitist, and so I call him a fucking moron; and while you may disagree with the precise diagnosis, there is no mistaking my contempt for what Collins has done.  The phrase has served its purpose. <br><i><br>    I'm not sure why you are comparing him to that conservative Ms Coulter. She's not a scientist, and not after truth, she's a pundit. Her bread and butter is spinning opinions for money; this is antithetical to the role of science, which it clarification and elucidation, going so far as to start with the null hypothesis. Pundits definitely don't start there.</i><br><br>Neither did Collins.  That's my whole point; what Collins wrote is also pretty damned antithetical to science.<br><i><br> I can't see that there is going to be some resolution of the problem "how do we determine the existence of an entity whose definition includes the property that it can do anything" any time soon.</i><br><br>I would question whether such a problem is even worth considering.  Imagine, for a moment, a world in which empiricism ruled.  We woke up in the morning, explored nature, drew what inferences we could, and argued about our findings around the dinner table.  In all of our explorations, we discovered not a shred of evidence that invisible purple hamsters lived up our butts and told us what to do.<br><br>Now.  What would be an appropriate response to someone who suggested we should consider such a possibility?  "What is your evidence?" we might ask, and we would be told "Oh, <i>these</i> invisible purple ass-dwelling hamsters cannot be detected by scientific means.  They are beyond time and space, so you will never be able to definitively disprove them using your puny empiricism."<br><br>And this is quite true, so far as it goes.  But I would still argue that anyone who believes that such a model is worth serious contemplation is (sorry, dude, here it comes again) a fucking moron.  Fortunately, Human civilization is far too smart to merely contemplate such unprovable models for millennia at a stretch.  Instead, we actually base entire civilizations upon them, and engage in an endless succession of bloody religious wars over whether the invisible hamsters are truly purple, or whether they live in the rectum or the lower jejunum.<br><br>Collins, you know &mdash; the dude has a lot of company.<br><br><br><i>    Are you really of the opinion that this question is on the brink of solution? I'm not being sarcastic, I'm interested. If so, why now? What makes you think we are near breakthrough hour?</i><br><br>No, I don't.  I didn't.  <i>But Collins, by virtue of his authority and his expertise, made me wonder if I had missed something</i>.   I thought we <i>might</i> be on the verge of a breakthrough even though I'd seen no evidence of it, because I like to pride myself on an open mind, and at first glance this guy seemed like the furthest thing from a crackpot.  I thought we might, because all it takes to convince me that I'm wrong is replicable evidence; and the book was subtitled "A scientist presents evidence for faith".<br><br>I got suckered.  That's what happens when you want to believe. <br><i><br>Whoa, whoa there! Oh no, of course not. That's hyperbole, I assume. I mean that problems that people puzzle over for thousands of years are probably big damn problems, and need lots of thought, so the statistical probability that you or I are/am alive when the brilliant breakthrough appears are low. Consider how long that Fermat thing took! I think we are hundreds of years away, if not thousands, from any definite answer on G/nG.</i><br><br>Well, a little hyperbole; but a whole lot of Moore's Law.  We're making far more breakthroughs/unit time during this generation than we ever have in the history of our species, and that rate is (so far, least) accelerating exponentially.  Even if you don't hop on the singularity bandwagon,  there's no denying that if you want to max out your odds of being alive for any given breakthrough, you could do a lot worse than landing on the 21rst century.</p>

        <p>Keith-bot,<br><br><i>That the moral law pushes us toward some instincts and away from others, and that the fact that the moral law acts on instincts proves it is not an instinct itself.</i><br><br>Not the most air-tight proposition, I must agree.<br><br><i>I cannot respect anyone who finds that reasoning convincing.</i><br><br>You know what it sounds like to me?  That Collins and Lewis are  using Philosophy-Speak, a la Plato/Socrates.  Empirical method is a smaller, sharper-edged tool than Socratic dialog.  Not to piss off the philosophy majors.<br><br>Plato's writing drives me nuts, because there is a tendancy to use a word for a large complex astraction, like "justice," then treat it as if it were a concrete physical entity with physical existence, instead being a set of related ideas.  Oh, say, "instinct" would be just a set, or "moral law."  Moral law can't push anything; moral law is not a physical entity.  It seems to lead, when people use Philosophy Speak, to the terrible logical error of confusing the word with the thing itself.  <br><br>Collins probably means moral law as the Christian strictures on individual lying, cheating, stealing, etc., and not other sets of moral law such as "what is best in life is to drive your enemy before you, burn their villages, and hear the lamentation of their women" or whatever.  <br><br>I haven't read the Collins book, which, dammitol, it looks like I have to now, but could he be having the Socrates problem, where he assumes the word can be used as if it were an actual absolute true object, not just sloppy human attempts to talk about reality? <br><br><i>Actually I thought this author was going to say things I hadn't heard before. Now I feel silly for getting my hopes up.</i><br><br>I feel that way about *both* sides, and yet I keep reading this stuff. It's like hitting myself on the head with a board, over and over. Please, someone convince me the absence of proof is proof of absence or whatever.<br><br><i>I said: "how do we determine the existence of an entity whose definition includes the property that it can do anything" <br><br>You replied: I have no problem with that particular god. I'm a naturalist skeptic. It's the supernatural sadistic miracle-working gods who crave human worship who piss me off.</i><br><br>Well, sure, why imagine a punitive God unless you feel you deserve punishment.  Or that someone you know deserves it.<br><br><i>The god you describe seems quite harmless.</i><br><br>He's quite benign. He is only harmful to the proposition that anything in physical reality can be modeled in English, manipulated in English, and a definite conclusion about the existence/non-existence of that thing can be reached.  From what I have seen, English is not up to the task, and logic is not up to the task, because they both require definitions, and the part of the definition where God gets to do anything He wills makes the definition unusable.  He's a logic buster, which could be harmful, I guess, if I couldn't live with the notion that logical analysis can't determine reality in all cases.  Or if I had that Socratic confusion about the words being the physical object.<br> <br><i>PS: I keep flunking the turing test! Is there a prize for proving you're a poorly-written AI?</i><br><br>ROTF!  As one poorly-written AI to another, the booby prize is that we get caught in a loop, two  reciprocal bots, replying to each other's programmed responses.  ha ha ha.  Poor us.  Somebody call the programmer!<br><br>Actually, this has been kinda fun.</p>

        <p>I don't quite get all of the shock over Frank Collins' irrational beliefs in the face of his scientific prowess.  Cognitive dissonance much?  How many great thinkers had kooky notions?  I suppose no one reads Isaac Newton's biography anymore.  Man was an alchemist, dilettante, and rabid fundie. Yet look at what he did when he was dabbling in the maths and sciences.  Doesn't Martin Rees have hysterical doomsday criticisms about particle accelerators?  Isn't Freeman Dyson pretty religious, possibly pro-ID, and critical of global warming to a fault?  Bill Joy's a neo-Luddite.  And then you drift further to the fringe and you get your Teslas.  (Not to mention Penrose?)<br><br>So is Collins a moron?  Possibly.  But isn't it more likely that he just had a severe case of cognitive dissonance?  It is an inescapable part of human psychology, I believe.</p>
