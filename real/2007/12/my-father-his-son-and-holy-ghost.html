Or maybe it's just that I've encountered a fair number of believers over the past decades, and I can't honestly dismiss all of them as complete idiots. </span>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">   </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Not that there aren't an awful <i><i>lot</i></i> of idiots in those ranks, you understand.<span style="">  </span>Almost half the human population on this continent thinks that Humanity was created pretty much in its present form six thousand years ago, that evolution is a fraud, and that the sky is swarming with angels.<span style="">  </span>Those people are fucking morons; there is so much overwhelming evidence to the contrary, so readily available to anyone with even rudimentary reading skills, that </span><span style="" lang="EN-CA">the only plausible alternatives to fucking-moronhood would be </span><span style="" lang="EN-CA">brainwashing or mental disease.<span style="">  </span>But I can't put people like my dad into that basket:  Baptist leader and teacher in the heart of the Alberta bible-belt of the sixties,<span style="">  </span>who — catching me at age twelve reading a James Bond novel — sat me down and told me that Ian Fleming didn’t really have the most respectful attitude towards women, and there were other books I might want to try out if I wanted insight into how to treat my fellow human beings.<span style="">  </span>Who, as I lay spinning on my bed in the dark at seventeen, vomit dribbling down my chin and exhaling enough ethanol to ignite the whole bloody house if my chain-smoking older brother happened to light up, sat on my bed and asked me about my day, and told me about his, and didn't even mention my inebriated state until I brought it up myself (and then just rolled his eyes and quoted Shakespeare — something about the devil than men put into their mouths to steal away their brains.<span style="">  </span>But I could feel him smiling in the dark when he said it.)<span style="">  </span>My dad, who never had any problems at all with science in general, or with evolution in particular. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">   </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">When I asked him — years later still — if he would at least stop believing in this Easter Bunny of his if presented with indisputable, convincing evidence of God's nonexistence, he thought for a moment and admitted that no, he most likely would not.<span style="">  </span>He lost some serious points with me then.<span style="">  </span>But still;<span style="">  </span>this man, and thousands more like him, are not idiots.<span style="">  </span>I cannot lump them in with the Falwells and the Bushies and the — well, with the 47% of the N'Amian population who <i><i>are</i></i> fucking morons.<span style="">  </span><span style=""> </span>I just can't.<span style="">   </span><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">I prefer to think of most of them not as stupid, but lazy.<span style="">  </span> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">   </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">Most people acquire their beliefs through osmosis and observation, not investigation.<span style="">  </span>We'd rather observe than derive.<span style="">  </span>Raised in a society awash in certain ubiquitous beliefs, you tend to accept those beliefs without thinking.<span style="">  </span>I think most people come to their faith in the same way they come to believe that not wearing a tie is "unprofessional office behaviour", even though ties are a prerequisite for very few office duties.<span style="">  </span>(There are good evolutionary reasons for this.<span style="">  </span>Who's going to get ahead fastest; the guy who reinvents every wheel from scratch, or the guy who looks around and copies those wheel-thingies all the grown-ups are using? <span style=""> </span>I mean, of course you should just do what the grown-ups do; <i><i>they</i></i> did it, and they were obviously fit enough to spawn...)  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">   </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">But what if I'm wrong?<span style="">  </span>One of the reasons science kicks religion's ass is that we always have to allow for the possibility that we could be wrong.<span style="">  </span>About <i><i>anything</i></i>.<span style="">  </span>Who was it remarked that <i><i>science offers proof without certainty; religion offers certainty without proof</i></i>? </span></p>    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-CA">So I'm always on the lookout for bright people, scientifically-inclined people, non-fucking-moron people, who have religious beliefs.<span style="">  </span>Because maybe they've thought of something I haven't.<span style="">  </span>Maybe they're right and I'm wrong; and man, wouldn't it be <i><i>great</i></i> to be wrong about this?<span style="">  </span>Wouldn't it absolutely kick ass if there actually <i><i>was</i></i> an afterlife, and a stigmatized Easter Bunny?

        <p>Smart people, being more skilled than average at playing devil's advocate, are generally very good at making good arguments for things they came to believe for non-smart reasons, and when this happens I then experience an obviously non-smart desire to do <a href="http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/4428/ginbankaleidoscopezo7.gif" rel="nofollow">this</a>. This is especially true when the exposed occurrence of rationalization is from myself.<br><br>Examples such as this re-enforce my agreement with Dawkins that the nature of faith makes it, for most practical considerations, a <i>disease</i>, with the mind as it's transmission vector, instead of just a bad idea. It being a contagious illness, of course, provides ample moral justification for running around doing <a href="http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/6084/purgeba4.jpg" rel="nofollow">this</a>, since deliberately spreading a disease is obviously something that can't be tolerated.<br><br>I am somewhat curious as to how Dawkins would react to his idea being used as justification for that sort of thing if anything actually came of it. For all we know he would be all in favor, but just won't say so until the opinions of religious moderates is no longer a consideration.<br><br>In any case, the existence of the sort of god that most books like this argue for is entirely besides the point, because it has nothing to do with the religion of ancient sheep-herders that believed every sort of animal lived within hiking distance of Noah's house that is actually practiced. Without those ideas of god as a starting point, I'm confident that the more recent, philosophical, deist beings would never even have been thought up. Science never goes so far as to assert it's own correctness in an absolute sense, but that <i>those</i> forms of belief are irredeemably <i>wrong</i>, in both truth and moral value, is something that a person can have conviction in, which is useful, because no weapon is a substitute for zeal.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone here has ever argued that consciousness is an illusion, just that it might be useless or counter-adaptive. Indeed, a rigorous analysis of what a person can possibly know <b>with absolute certainty</b> quickly cuts out all knowledge <b>except</b> that one is concious. That is the origin of the phrase, "I think, therefore I am."</p>

        <p>I notice the universe is amazingly well-suited for the evolution of interesting life, which can make me a deist on even-numbered months... but the god of Abraham?

What do you believe?" And I stuttered and stammered and felt the color rise in my face, and said, "Well, I don't think I believe in anything." But it suddenly seemed like a very thin answer. And that was unsettling.

        <p>I didn't read the book, but from what I have read of it, the author's "proof" of god is just as flagrantly specious as Descartes' in his famed work (which ar was quoting). <br><br>Morality does NOT denote a divine, universal law. His first flaw as far as I can see it is that <b>the idea of morality is not universal across all cultures</b>, as he appears to say it is (by asserting that morality is universal, he suggests that it could not have arisen by evolution but rather by some divine law). <br><br>Second, I'm fairly certain that a human kept in isolation will not spontaneously develop a sense of right and wrong beyond what causes pain and what causes pleasure. Further, they are not so endowed with this from birth. <br><br>In fact, I can't imagine a simpler explanation of why right/wrong exists than it is merely a mechanism that allows society to function more adequately, which was evolutionarily selected for because societies are advantageous. Along with language and all the other crap he uses as justification. <br><br>AS for consciousness not existing, I don't know if I believe that. The same is true for rigorous analysis of truth coming to the conclusion that the only thing able to be proved is that you are aware. There are many differing opinions on this, and I think it's best to take the middle ground.<br><br>For instance, nihilism is seemingly perpetually in vogue among certain groups and is one extreme of the knowledge question. The only issue with it is that it is not self consistent (the only truth is that there is no truth), a problem thats run into a lot with so-called "rigorous" proofs of truth. <br><br>And even beyond that, there are many conceptions of truth itself. For instance, there's the concept of aletheia, which denotes truth simply as that which is no longer obscured or unknown. Which is perfectly valid--truth exists just fine and it's a matter of uncovering it. <br><br>Anyway, the moral of this story is always take broad, sweeping claims with a grain of salt.</p>

The fact is I'm abysmally ignorant of Eastern philosophy (hell, I'm pretty damn ignorant of Western philsophy too &mdash; not to mention Northern and Southern Philosophy).  I've tried to take a stab at one or two of those popsci books that take an Eastern view of quantum physics, but all I took home from them was the confidence that now I'd actually read up on the subject, I was justified in making ignorant and judgmental generalisations.  (I tried to read <i>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</i>, for example, but I refuse to take seriously any author who evidently can't count to two).<br><i><br><b>Keith said...<br></b><br>    I notice the universe is amazingly well-suited for the evolution of interesting life, which can make me a deist on even-numbered months... but the god of Abraham? Why that one?<br><br></i>Because (according to Collins) the existence of The Moral Law implies a personal, Golden-Rule kinda god, rather than one who just winds up the Rube Goldberg machine at t=0 and spends the next 30 billion years watching it unwind.  (Except that elsewhere in the book he insists that that's pretty much what god <i>did</i> do, because otherwise there would be no suffering and/or free will.  Or something equally incoherent.  I had a hard time keeping track of all the inconsistencies...)<br><br><b>Nicholas said...<br></b><br> (...a bunch of stuff I'm snipping because I have nothing to add, but which is remarkably spot-on for someone who didn't read the book.

He starts referencing all sorts of studies claiming there is actual evidence for this.</i><br><br>Pretty sure he's wrong on that score.  But I feel your pain:  what do you <i>do</i> when someone cites chapter and verse of an authority you've never heard of before, that contradicts everything you've learned to that point?  Dismiss their sources out-of-hand and you're being closed-minded.  Accept them and you've most likely been suckered by some piece of pseudoscientific crap.  Withhold judgment pending further input and you're a mealy-mouthed fence-sitter.  My own approach is to raise a skeptical eyebrow and say "That's pretty inconsistent with the studies I've seen.  I'd be really interested in seeing those figures first-hand."<br><br><b>Julie K said...<br></b><i><br>    Let me guess - is it the one about the frozen stream?<br><br></i>Yes!  Exactly!

        <p><i>I don't think anyone here has ever argued that consciousness is an illusion, just that it might be useless or counter-adaptive.
