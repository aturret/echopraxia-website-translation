					 	<p class="p-first"><span id="text-initial">T</span>he past 
century has witnessed what Sujeit describes as “a&nbsp;joyful if weedy 
renaissance of&nbsp;Faith in&nbsp;the face of the secular… an inevitable
 reaction to science’s vendetta against the soul”. This has been 
a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;ongoing consternation to the secular community. 
Surely, they say, the more science explains, the less we need to invoke 
the supernatural. Surely the “God of&nbsp;the Gaps” diminishes with each
 new scientific breakthrough. How then to explain not just the 
persistence but an actual resurgence of faith in a&nbsp;world where 
every last vestige of&nbsp;humanity can be “explained” by the invocation
 of some brain structure or chemical process?</p>
							<p>Ironically, it is thanks to the empiricists themselves that we
 can answer this question. It has been known for generations that Faith 
flourishes most strongly when people feel threatened and powerless. What
 could be more threatening — what could make a&nbsp;soul feel more 
powerless — than an&nbsp;endless litany of&nbsp;scientific “discoveries”
 hammering home our utter insignificance in a&nbsp;vast and indifferent 
cosmos, reducing every flicker of the Human soul to&nbsp;chemicals and 
electricity, telling us that the&nbsp;very notion of free will is 
logically absurd in a&nbsp;mechanistic universe? <a href="#footnotes" class="foot" id="footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
 Science itself has provoked this return to God — and once again we see 
His Hand in that precisely-designed mechanism ensuring that our faith is
 strongest when it is most desperately needed.</p>
							<p>While we may thank this divine feedback loop for reversing the last generation’s exodus from the Church of Rome <a href="#footnotes" class="foot" id="footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
 it has also played a&nbsp;role in a&nbsp;recent proliferation of cults 
whose elements borrow from a&nbsp;variety of pagan and pantheistic 
sources, and whose tenets pose a&nbsp;fundamental obstacle 
to&nbsp;Salvation. Such cults have always been with us, springing 
to&nbsp;life on stony ground and withering just as&nbsp;quickly. The 
Abrahamic religions, rooted in richer soil, have outlasted them all and 
continue to thrive even under the&nbsp;tumultuous conditions of 
the&nbsp;late twenty-first century.</p>
							<p>These are, however, times of uncertainty; and in the&nbsp;face 
of&nbsp;modern challenges we may find ourselves tempted to&nbsp;follow 
the example of&nbsp;certain Protestant denominations and turn our backs 
on the&nbsp;wider world. Such retreat in the&nbsp;face of&nbsp;adversity
 would not only go against the&nbsp;Scriptural admonition to “go and 
make disciples of all nations”, but also risks dire consequence 
in&nbsp;its own right.</p>
							<p>The Redeemer Gyland offers a&nbsp;stark case in&nbsp;point. It
 has been almost a year since the alliance between the Southern and 
Central Baptists broke down, and three months since we have been able 
to&nbsp;establish contact with anyone from either side of that conflict.
 (It is no&nbsp;longer practical to&nbsp;board the gyland directly — any
 craft approaching within two kilometers is fired upon — but remote 
surveillance has yielded no&nbsp;evidence of human activity since March 
28. The UN believes that the weapons fire is automated, and has declared
 Redeemer off-limits until those defenses exhaust their ammunition.)</p>

					<p class="p-first">
In contrast to the&nbsp;failed retreat of
 the&nbsp;southern Baptists, other faiths have tried “broadening their 
appeal” to “keep up with changing times”. The essential wickedness 
of&nbsp;this approach is perhaps best exemplified by the so-called 
“Moksha Mind” engineered by the Eastern Dharmic Alliance. Their attempts
 to “modernize” their faith — through the embrace of&nbsp;technology 
that has been (rightly) banned in the&nbsp;West — resulted in 
a&nbsp;literally soul-destroying hive that has plunged millions into 
what we can only assume to be a&nbsp;state of deep catatonia. (The fact 
that this is&nbsp;exactly what the Dharmic faiths have aspired to for 
millennia does not render their fate any less tragic.) The misguided use
 of&nbsp;brain interface technology to&nbsp;“commune” with the minds of 
such alien creatures as cats and octopi — a&nbsp;practice by 
no&nbsp;means limited to the&nbsp;East — has also resulted 
in&nbsp;untold psychological damage.</p>	
					<p>Historically, therefore, the Holy See has never had cause to 
feel threatened by the transient appeal of the&nbsp;cults forever 
flowering around our ankles in the&nbsp;morning, only to&nbsp;blow away 
by nightfall. To date, we have also taken this attitude of benign 
tolerance regarding the so-called Bicameral Order. </p>
					<p>It is the&nbsp;considered opinion of this committee, however, 
that continuing complacency would be a&nbsp;terrible mistake in this 
case. We believe the Order represents a&nbsp;threat not only to the Holy
 Church of Rome, but to all Abrahamic religions.

			<h5 class="centered"><span>The Limits of Science</span></h5>
			<p class="p-first">The purview of science is a&nbsp;narrow one: it 
deals only with questions of how the cosmos works. The deeper issues 
of&nbsp;why reality even exists — and of&nbsp;our rightful place therein
 — are beyond its reach. The Church is not threatened by 
the&nbsp;procession of discoveries and insights hailing from 
the&nbsp;scientific method, because worldly matters are not within its 
domain. As St. Gould famously opined, Science and Faith occupy 
“non-overlapping magisteria”. It is no&nbsp;more the place of 
the&nbsp;Church to&nbsp;make testable hypotheses than it is 
the&nbsp;place of Science to&nbsp;pass judgment on matters of 
the&nbsp;spirit. </p>
			<p>It is perhaps too-infrequently noted, however, that science can 
claim no&nbsp;better understanding than the&nbsp;Church even in 
the&nbsp;matter of how the&nbsp;universe works.</p>	
			<p>This is a&nbsp;surprisingly uncontroversial view even among 
scientists, most of&nbsp;whom admit not only that science cannot claim 
to accurately describe reality, but that it cannot even claim 
to&nbsp;approach greater accuracy as it progresses. Yes, Einstein’s 
physics produce more accurate predictions than Newton’s — but 
a&nbsp;model in&nbsp;which celestial bodies are affixed to a&nbsp;series
 of concentric crystal spheres produces more accurate predictions of 
planetary motion than one which posits only a&nbsp;single sphere. Is it 
more “realistic”?
</p>	
			<p>So while Science may produce ever-more-accurate predictions about 
how reality behaves under known conditions, it can never claim to 
understand what lies within that black box (a&nbsp;century after its 
introduction, Smolin’s “Breeder Multiverse” remains untested and 
untestable even in&nbsp;principle — a&nbsp;mathematical construct to be 
taken on&nbsp;faith no&nbsp;less than the existence of God Himself). 
Ultimately, all science is mere correlation. For that matter, in 
the&nbsp;time before science people turned to&nbsp;religion 
to&nbsp;understand the&nbsp;physical universe; and while 
the&nbsp;thought of&nbsp;deities hurling lightning bolts may seem 
fanciful to modern minds, it was then (as science claims to&nbsp;be now)
 the best explanation available to&nbsp;limited human understanding. </p>	
			<p>The fundamental difference between Science and Scripture is not, 
therefore, that scientific insights are necessarily more realistic than 
those based upon Faith. The difference is no&nbsp;more and no&nbsp;less 
than predictive power. Scientific insights have proven to&nbsp;be better
 predictors than Spiritual ones, at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;worldly matters; 
they prevail not because they are true, but simply because they work.</p>
			
			<h5 class="centered"><span>The Bicameral Threat</span></h5>
			<p>The Bicamerals represent a&nbsp;stark anomaly in&nbsp;this 
otherwise consistent landscape. We have exhaustively reviewed their 
publications and the&nbsp;predictions contained therein. Their 
methodologies appear to&nbsp;be explicitly faith-based, and they venture
 unapologetically into metaphysical realms which defy empirical analysis
 — yet they yield results with consistently more predictive power than 
conventional science. (How they do&nbsp;this is not known; our best 
evidence suggests some kind of rewiring of the&nbsp;temporal lobe in 
a&nbsp;way that amplifies their connection to the&nbsp;Divine.) </p>	
			<p>It would be dangerously naïve to&nbsp;regard this as 
a&nbsp;victory for traditional religion. It is not. It is a&nbsp;victory
 for a&nbsp;radical sect barely half a&nbsp;century old, and the cost 
of&nbsp;that victory has been to&nbsp;demolish the&nbsp;wall between 
science and faith. The Church’s concession of the&nbsp;physical realm 
informed the&nbsp;historic armistice which has allowed faith and reason 
to&nbsp;coexist in&nbsp;separate and inviolable domains to&nbsp;this 
day. One may find it&nbsp;heartening to&nbsp;see faith ascendant once 
again across the Human spectrum; but it is not our faith. Its hand still
 guides lost sheep away from the soulless empiricism of&nbsp;secular 
science, but the&nbsp;days in&nbsp;which it&nbsp;guided them into 
the&nbsp;loving arms of&nbsp;Our Savior are waning. </p>
			<p>The Bicameral Order does not proselytize, preferring to stay out 
of the&nbsp;public eye (a&nbsp;suspicious sign in and of&nbsp;itself). 
Nonetheless, its ability to work miracles on&nbsp;demand cannot help but
 draw notice. While the&nbsp;ultimate consequences of&nbsp;their 
arrogance will be evident to&nbsp;anyone familiar with Genesis’s 
metaphor of the&nbsp;forbidden fruit, the inevitable near-term impact is
 to&nbsp;put more venerable institutions at a&nbsp;significant 
disadvantage.</p>	
			<p>Under current circumstances, therefore, we foresee 
the&nbsp;collapse of the Abrahamic religions — possibly even of the 
Dharmic and Taoist faiths to&nbsp;which the Bicamerals claim 
at&nbsp;least tenuous kinship — within as&nbsp;little as a&nbsp;single 
generation. (Indeed it may already be too late for the&nbsp;Eastern 
faiths, thanks to their ongoing embrace of the so-called “Nirvana 
Initiative”. To the&nbsp;best of&nbsp;our knowledge none who have joined
 that soul-destroying network have ever freed themselves, and whatever 
entity they form collectively has yet to communicate with 
the&nbsp;outside world in&nbsp;any meaningful way).</p>
			
			<h5 class="centered"><span>Recommendations</span></h5>
			<p>Having exhaustively considered and prayed upon 
the&nbsp;alternatives, we implore His Holiness to&nbsp;pursue 
a&nbsp;clandestine alliance of the&nbsp;Abrahamic religions, pursuant 
to&nbsp;meeting this common threat to&nbsp;our existence. 
The&nbsp;conflicts and internecine squabbles that have historically 
occurred between our respective faiths pale into insignificance next to 
the&nbsp;crisis currently brewing. The task before us will be daunting 
enough even in the&nbsp;company of&nbsp;powerful allies; standing alone,
 it&nbsp;would likely prove impossible.</p>	
			<p>God help us, we see no&nbsp;recourse but drastic action. </p>
