<strong>Now</strong></h1>
		
				<div class="container hyphenate">
			
					      <div class="text hyphenate">
					 
					        <h4>You know the drill. You think you do, anyway.</h4>
					        <p class="p-first">You know all the akas: Hamburger. Spam 
in a can. Infantry's just another word for cannon fodder where you come 
from: the important battles are all fought in the wires anyway these 
days, and they're over in nanoseconds. The last thing you want is to end
 up in some godforsaken shithole where meat still matters, where you've 
got to splice yourself into a clanking armored exoskeleton just to keep 
from getting squashed the moment your boots hit the ground.</p> 

							<p>You don't want any part of that freak show. It's hard enough getting laid without having cannons for arms.</p>

							<p>But here's the deal:</p>

							<h4>Everything you know is bullshit.</h4>
							<p class="p-first">Who do you think protects the wires? How do 
you think online combat could even happen, without forces in the field 
to guard the servers and the generators and the physical plants? Even 
today, it all comes down to people. The systems that protect our 
borders, our corporations— our very way of life— are built around human 
hearts. They always will be.</p>
							
							<h4>Hearts like yours.</h4>
							<p class="p-first">We'll outfit you with rattlesnake genes that 
let you see in the dark. Extra mitochondria to double your strength and 
your stamina. We'll slide flexible armor under your skin, special 
polysaccharides to keep out the blades and bullets without turning you 
into some kind of crab-shelled freak. Most of your augments 
won't even be visible to the naked eye.</p>
							<p>Best of all, you can literally sleep through most of your 
tour. Once we work our magic you'll be able to free your mind and let 
your body run itself. And we guarantee that body will be up to the 
challenge. Its reflexes will be faster. Its aim will be better. Its 
tactical decisions will be smarter. Your body on autopilot will be at 
least 300% safer than it would be if you were awake. That's a fact.</p>
							<p>Live through two years, get paid for five. If you can find a better deal, take it.</p>
							
							<h4>But what about the future?</h4>
							
							<p class="p-first">When you successfully complete your tour, you 
get to keep most of your battlefield augments. The night vision. The 
enhanced strength. The subdermal armor.</p>
							<p>Even the Off Switch.</p>
							<p>Because we know who you are. We know where you live. You know 
the odds of making it to your thirtieth birthday as well as we do. And 
you have more than yourself to worry about now. Tomoki said his first 
words just a few weeks ago, isn't that right? You know what's in store 
for him if something doesn't change. If you sign up now, you'll be back in 
time to protect him during those formative years, and better equipped 
than ever.</p>
							<p>So forget the battlefield. Forget all the action you'll be dreaming through.</p>
							
							<h4>Think of the edge you'll have when you get back home.</h4>
							<p class="p-first">Those fuckers from the Span won't know what hit them.</p>
