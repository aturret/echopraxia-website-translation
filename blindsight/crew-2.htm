You can drop instantly into the sensorium of anyone under your command, experience the battlefield from any number of first-person perspectives.  Your every soldier is loyal unto death, asking no questions, obeying all commands with alacrity and dedication to which mere flesh could never even aspire.  You don\'t just respect a chain of command:  you <i>are</i> one.<br><br>You are a little bit scared of your own power.  You are a little bit scared of the things you\'ve already done with it.<br><br>Taking orders comes as naturally as giving them.  Oh, you\'ve been known to question policy on occasion, or seek a bigger picture than may be strictly necessary for the job at hand.  Your <i>command initiative </i>has become the stuff of legends.  But you have never disobeyed  a direct order.  When asked for your perspective, you serve it straight up and unvarnished— until the decision is made, and the orders handed down.  Then you do your job without question.  Even when questions arise, you would hardly waste time asking them unless you expected an answer you could use. <br><br>Why, then, demand analytical details from a <i>vampire</i>?<br><br>Not for information.  Might as well expect the sighted to explain vision to the congenitally blind.  Not for clarification; there was no ambiguity in Sarasti\'s bottom line.  Not even for the benefit of poor dumb Siri Keeton, who may have missed some salient point but is too ashamed to raise his own hand.<br><br>No, there is only one reason why you might ask for such details: to <i>challenge</i>.  To rebel, to the infinitesimal degree that rebellion is permitted once the word is given.<br><br>You argued and advocated as forcefully as you could, back when Sarasti was soliciting input.  But he ignored yours, abandoned any attempt at communication and preemptively invaded foreign territory.  He knew that <i>Rorschach</i> might contained living beings and still he tore it open without regard for their welfare.  He may have killed helpless innocents.  He may have roused an angry giant.  You don\'t know.<br><br>All you know is, you\'ve been helping him do it.<br><br>You\'ve seen this kind of arrogance before, among your own kind.  You had hoped that smarter creatures would be wiser ones.  Bad enough to see such arrogant stupidity inflicted on the helpless, but to do it at these stakes beggars belief.  Killing innocents is the <i>least</i> of the risks you\'re running; you\'re gambling with the fate of worlds, provoking conflict with a star faring technology whose sole offense was to take your picture without permission.<br><br>Your dissent has changed nothing.  So you rein it in; all that slips out now is the occasional pointless question with no hope of an answer, its inherent insubordination so deeply buried you don\'t even see it yourself.  If you did see it, you\'d keep your mouth shut entirely—because the last thing you want is to remind Sarasti that you think he\'s <i>wrong</i>.  You don\'t want him dwelling on that.  You don\'t want him to think you\'re up to something.<br><br>Because you are.

She tapped her temple.  \'\'There\'s a lot of room up here;  a modern brain can run dozens of sentient cores without getting too crowded.  And parallel multitasking has obvious survival advantages.\'\'<br><br>I nodded.  \'\'Ten heads are better than one.\'\'<br><br>\'\'Our integration may have actually occurred quite recently.  Some experts think we can still revert to multiples under the right circumstances.\'\'<br><br>\'\'Well, of course.  You\'re living proof.\'\'<br><br>She shook their head.  \'\'I\'m not talking about <i>physical </i> partitioning.  We\'re the state of the art, certainly, but theoretically surgery isn\'t even necessary.  Simple stress could do something like it, if it was strong enough.  If it happened early in childhood.\'\'<br><br>\'\'No kidding.\'\'<br><br>\'\'Well, in theory,\'\'  James admitted, and changed into Sascha who said, \'\'Bull<i>shit in theory</i>.  There\'s documented cases as recently as fifty years ago.\'\'<br><br>\'\'Really.\'\'  I resisted the temptation to look it up on my inlays; the unfocused eyes can be a giveaway.  \'\'I didn\'t know.\'\'<br><br>\'\'Well it\'s not like anyone talks about it <i>now</i>.  People were fucking <i>barbarians</i> about multicores back then — called it a <i>disorder</i>, treated it like some kind of disease.  And their idea of a cure was to keep one of the cores and murder all the others.  Not that they called it <i>murder</i>, of course.  They called it <i>integration</i> or some shit.   That\'s what people did back then: created other people to suck up all the abuse and torture, then got rid of them when they weren\'t needed any more.\'\'<br><br>It hadn\'t been the tone most of us were looking for at an ice-breaking party.  James had gently eased back into the driver\'s seat and the conversation had steered closer to community standards.<br><br>But I hadn\'t heard any of the Gang use <i>alter</i> to describe each other, then or since.  It had seemed innocuous enough when Szpindel had said it.  I wondered why they\'d taken such offence — and now, floating alone in my tent with a few pre-op minutes to kill, there was no one to see my eyes glaze.<br><br><i>Alter</i> carried baggage over a century old, ConSensus told me.  Sascha was right; there\'d been a time when MCC was MPD, a <i>Disorder</i> rather than a <i>Complex</i>, and it had <i>never</i> been induced deliberately.  According to the experts of that time, multiple personalities arose spontaneously from unimaginable cauldrons of abuse — fragmentary personae offered up to suffer rapes and beatings while the child behind took to some unknowable sanctuary in the folds of the brain.  It was both survival strategy and ritual self-sacrifice:  powerless souls hacking themselves to pieces, offering up quivering chunks of self in the desperate hope that the vengeful gods called <i>Mom</i> or <i>Dad</i> might not be insatiable.<br><br>None of it had been real, as it turned out.  Or at least, none of it had been confirmed.  The experts of the day had been little more than witch doctors dancing through improvised rituals:  meandering free-form interviews full of leading questions and nonverbal cues, scavenger hunts through regurgitated childhoods.  Sometimes a shot of lithium or haloperidol when the beads and rattles didn\'t work.  The technology to map minds was barely off the ground; the technology to edit them was years away.  So the <i>therapists</i> and <i>psychiatrists</i> poked at their victims and invented names for things they didn\'t understand, and argued over the shrines of Freud and Klein and the old Astrologers.  Doing their very best to sound like practitioners of Science.  <br><br>Inevitably, it was Science that turned them all into road kill; MPD was a half-forgotten fad even before the advent of synaptic rewiring.  But <i>alter</i> was a word from that time, and its resonance had persisted.  Among those who remembered the tale, <i>alter</i> was codespeak for <i>betrayal</i> and <i>human sacrifice</i>.  <i>Alter</i> meant <i>cannon fodder</i>.<br><br>Imagining the topology of the Gang\'s coexisting souls, I could see why Sascha embraced the mythology.  I could see why Susan let her.  After all, there was nothing implausible about the concept; the Gang\'s very existence proved that much.  And when you\'ve been peeled off from a pre-existing entity, sculpted from nonexistence straight into adulthood — a mere fragment of personhood, without even a full-time body to call your own — you can be forgiven a certain amount of anger.  Sure you\'re all equal, all in it together.  Sure, no persona is better than any other.  Susan\'s still the only one with a surname.<br><br>Better to direct that resentment at old grudges, real or imagined; less problematic, at least, than taking it out on someone who shares the same flesh.<br><br>I realized something else, too.  Surrounded by displays documenting the relentless growth of the leviathan beneath us, I could not only see why Sascha had objected to the word; I could also see why Isaac Szpindel, no doubt unconsciously, had spoken it in the first place.<br><br>As far as Earth was concerned, everyone on <i>Theseus</i> was an alter.<br><br>','<b>James, Susan (AKA <i>The Gang of Four</i>)</b><br>linguist, multicore personae');return true">

But most people don\'t think that\'s what I\'m doing.  They don\'t know how much their bodies betray when they close their mouths.  When they speak aloud, it\'s because they want to confide; when they don\'t, they think they\'re keeping their opinions to themselves.  I watch them so closely, customize each word so that no system ever feels <i>used</i> —  and yet for some reason, that didn\'t work with Robert Cunningham.<br><br>I think I was modeling the wrong system.<br><br>Imagine you are a synthesist.  You deal in the behavior of systems at their surfaces, infer the machinery <i>beneath</i> from its reflections <i>above</i>.  That is the secret of your success:  you understand the system by understanding the boundaries that contain it.<br><br>Now imagine you encounter someone who has ripped a hole in those boundaries and bled beyond them.<br><br>Robert Cunningham\'s flesh could not contain him.  His duties pulled him beyond the meat sack; here in the Oort, his topology rambled all over the ship.  That was true of all of us, to some extent; Bates and her drones, Sarasti and his limbic link — even the ConSensus inlays in our heads <i>diffused</i> us a bit, spread us just slightly beyond the confines of our own bodies.  But Bates only ran her drones; she never <i>inhabited</i> them.  The Gang of Four may have run multiple systems on a single motherboard, but each had its own distinct topology and they only surfaced one at a time.  And Sarasti — <br><br>Well, Sarasti was a whole different story, as it turned out.<br><br>Cunningham didn\'t just operate his remotes; he <i>escaped</i> into them, wore them like a secret identity to hide the feeble Human baseline within.  He had sacrificed half of his neocortex for the chance to see x-rays and taste the shapes hiding in cell membranes, he had butchered one body to become a fleeting tenant of many.  Pieces of him hid in the sensors and manipulators that lined the scrambler\'s cages;  I might have gleaned vital cues from every piece of equipment in the subdrum if I\'d ever thought to look.  Cunningham was a topological jigsaw like everyone else, but half his pieces were hidden in machinery.  My model was incomplete.<br><br>I don\'t think he ever aspired to such a state.  Looking back, I see radiant self-loathing on every remembered surface.  But there in the waning years of the twenty-first century, the only alternative he could see was the life of a parasite.  Cunningham merely chose the lesser evil.  <br><br>Now, even that was denied him.   Sarasti\'s orders had severed him from his own sensorium.  He no longer <i>felt</i> the data in his gut; he had to <i>interpret</i> it,  step by laborious step, through screens and graphs that reduced perception to flat empty shorthand.  Here was a system traumatized by multiple amputations.  Here was a system with its eyes and ears and tongue cut out, forced to stumble and feel its way around things it had once <i>inhabited</i>, right down in the bone.  Suddenly there was nowhere else to hide, and all those far-flung pieces of Robert Cunningham tumbled back into his flesh where I could see them at last.<br><br>It had been my mistake, all along.  I\'d been so focused on modelling other systems that I\'d forgotten about the one doing the modelling.
